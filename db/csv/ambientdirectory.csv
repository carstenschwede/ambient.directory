One key part of this complex problem is providing awareness of senior adults’ day-to-day activities, promoting peace of mind for extended family members. In this paper, we introduce the concept of a digital family portrait that provides qualitative visualizations of a family member’s daily life. Leveraging a familiar household object, the picture frame, our design populates the frame with iconic imagery summarizing 28 days.

However, for successful applications to emerge, it will not be the quantity but the quality and usefulness of connections that will matter. Our concern is how qualitative relations and more selective connections can be established between smart artefacts, and how users can retain control over artefact interconnection. We propose context proximity for selective artefact communication, using the context of artefacts for matchmaking. We further suggest to empower users with simple but effective means to impose the same context on a number of artefacts. To prove our point we have implemented Smart-Its Friends, small embedded devices that become connected when a user holds them together and shakes them.",Citations: 674,978-3-540-42614-1 978-3-540-45427-4,en

User experiences show that NC becomes a rich resource for awareness and collaboration. Community members use it to indicate their presence to others by posting live video onto it. They regularly act on this information by engaging in text and video conversations. Because others can overhear these conversations, these become opportunities to join in. They also post items they believe will be interesting to others, such as vacation photos.

This paper proposes a new subdomain for infovis research that complements the focus on analytic tasks and expert use. Instead of work-related and analytically driven infovis, we propose Casual Information Visualization (or Casual Infovis) as a complement to more traditional infovis domains. Traditional infovis systems, techniques, and methods do not easily lend themselves to the broad range of user populations, from expert to novices, or from work tasks to more everyday situations. We propose definitions, perspectives, and research directions for further investigations of this emerging subfield. These perspectives build from ambient information visualization [32], social visualization, and also from artistic work that visualizes information [41]. We seek to provide a perspective on infovis that integrates these research agendas under a coherent vocabulary and framework for design. We enumerate the following contributions. First, we demonstrate how blurry the boundary of infovis is by examining systems that exhibit many of the putative properties of infovis systems, but perhaps would not be considered so. Second, we explore the notion of insight and how, instead of a monolithic definition of insight, there may be multiple types, each with particular characteristics. Third, we discuss design challenges for systems intended for casual audiences. Finally we conclude with challenges for system evaluation in this emerging subfield.",Citations: 413,,en

This is done by dynamic glowing patterns produced by electroluminescent wires molded into the transparent electrical cord. Using this fully functional prototype, we have been investigating how such ambient displays can be used to increase energy awareness.

Initially, content (videos, images and news) are presented in a random manner. Using cameras installed on the signs, the system observes the audience and detects if someone is watching the content (via face detection). The anonymous view time duration is then stored in a central database, together with date, time and sign location. When scheduling content, the signs calculate the expected view time for each content type depending on sign location and time using a Naive Bayes classifier. Content is then selected randomly, with the probability for each content weighted by the expected view time. The system has been deployed for two months on four digital signs in a university setting using semirealistic content \& content types.

It addresses the need to acknowledge a recently emerging number of visualization projects that combine information visualization techniques with principles of creative design. The proposed model contributes to a better understanding of information aesthetics as a potentially independent research field within visualization that specifically focuses on the experience of aesthetics, dataset interpretation and interaction. The proposed model is based on analysing existing visualization techniques by their interpretative intent and data mapping inspiration. It reveals information aesthetics as the conceptual link between information visualization and visualization art, and includes the fields of social and ambient visualization. This model is unique in its focus on aesthetics as the artistic influence on the technical implementation and intended purpose of a visualization technique, rather than subjective aesthetic judgments of the visualization outcome. This research provides a framework for understanding aesthetics in visualization, and allows for new design guidelines and reviewing criteria.",Citations: 188,978-0-7695-2900-4,en

Yet, we have many opportunities to conserve it. One particular opportunity for water conservation is the shower, because depending on the shower head and shower habits, an individual can save many liters of fresh water each day. Feedback proved to be an effective method to promote sustainable behavior. Therefore, in this paper we suggest to promote water conservation by providing feedback in form of an ambient display that can easily be integrated in current shower types. We built a prototype to study the potential of such a feedback device. These shower water meter (show-me) display the amount of water, that is used during one shower in form of LEDs assembled on a stick. Thus, an increasing water level is visualized. The user study revealed two groups. The subjects who considered themselves as ecologically conscious changed their behavior and turned the water down or off while soaping. Also, they are willing to pursue this behavior. Other subjects who did not have the goal to act more sustainable, were surprised about their water consumption and tried to reduce it. However, after the removal of the show-me device they did not maintain their behavior and fell back into their previous habit.",Citations: 138,978-1-60558-376-1,en

It was verified that the disruptiveness and effectiveness of notifications varied with the notification modality. The olfactory modality was shown to be less effective in delivering notifications than the other modalities, but produced a less disruptive effect on user engagement in the primary task.

Inspired by this observation, several researchers have studied interactive systems that display digital information in the periphery of attention. To broaden the scope of this research direction, a few recent studies have focused on interactive systems that can not only be perceived in the background but also enable users to physically interact with digital information in their periphery. Such peripheral interaction designs can support computing technology to fluently embed in and become a meaningful part of people’s everyday routines. With the increasing ubiquity of technology in our everyday environment, we believe that this direction is highly relevant nowadays. This paper presents an in-depth analysis of three case studies on peripheral interaction. These case studies involved the design and development of peripheral interactive systems and deployment of these systems in the real context of use for a number of weeks. Based on the insights gained through these case studies, we discuss generalized characteristics and considerations for peripheral interaction design and evaluation. The aim of the work presented in this paper is to support interaction design researchers and practitioners in anticipating and facilitating peripheral interaction with the designs they are evaluating or developing.",Citations: 97,,en

Weiser’s main message was not the ubiquity of computers, but the transparency of interface that determines users’ perception of digital technologies embedded in our physical environment seamlessly. To explore Weiser’s philosophy of transparency in interfaces, this paper presents the design of an interface that uses glass bottles as “containers” and “controls” for digital information. The metaphor is a perfume bottle: Instead of scent, the bottles have been filled with music — classical, jazz, and techno music. Opening each bottle releases the sound of a specific instrument accompanied by dynamic colored light. Physical manipulation of the bottles —opening and closing — is the primary mode of interaction for controlling their musical contents. The bottles illustrates Mark Weiser’s vision of the transparent (or invisible) interface that weaves itself into the fabric of everyday life. The bottles also exploits the emotional aspects of glass bottles that are tangible and visual, and evoke the smell of perfume and the taste of exotic beverages. This paper describes the design goals of the bottle interface, the arrangement of musical content, the implementation of the wireless electromagnetic tag technology, and the feedback from users who have played with the system.",Citations: 84,,en

In this paper, we propose applying ambient TORs, which address the peripheral vision of a driver. Conducting an experiment in a driving simulator, we tested a) ambient displays as TORs, b) whether contextual information could be conveyed through ambient TORs, and c) if the presentation pattern (static, moving) of the contextual TORs has an effect on take-over behavior. Results showed that conveying contextual information through ambient displays led to shorter reaction times and longer times to collision without increasing the workload.

Older adults who are not adopting SNSs might however feel like outsiders within their own families who increasingly rely on these services to socialize. Previous research has shown that situated displays can provide appropriate interfaces for older adults to use digital services. In this paper we explore how situated displays can intuitively provide ambient awareness to strengthen the family social network of older adults. We designed and developed Tlatoque, a situated display, to seamlessly integrate older adults into the SNS used by their relatives. The results of a 21-week deployment study of an initial version of Tlatoque in one extended family showed that the older adult became more conscious of relatives’ activities, which also enriched in-person encounters. However, relatives expected the older adult to reply to their posts in the SNS and Tlatoque lacked mechanisms for the older adult to provide feedback. We re-designed Tlatoque to incorporate means for enabling the older adult to share information back to the SNS. We conducted a second 21-week deployment study with another extended family to evaluate the use of this new version of the system. Our results indicate that the second design was successful in providing ambient awareness to the older adult as well as to her relatives. We conclude that situated displays that provide SNS services can assist the integration of older adults to their social network and contribute to enhance asymmetric relations between the older adult and younger relatives.",Citations: 69,,en

We study the process of orchestration in recitation sections, i.e. when students work on their assignments individually or in small groups with the presence of teaching assistants who give help on demand. Our empirical study revealed that recitation sections suffer from inefficient orchestration. Too much attention is devoted to the management of the relationship between students and teaching assistants, which prevent both sides from concentrating on their main task. We present a model of students’ activities during recitation sections that emphasize the issue of mutual awareness, i.e. monitoring help needs and TA's availability. To tackle these difficulties, we developed two awareness tools. Both tools convey the same information: which exercise each group is working on, whether it has asked for help and for how long. In the centralized version, named Shelf, students provide information with a personal response system and the status of each team is juxtaposed on a central display. In the distributed version, named Lantern, each team provides information by interacting with a lamp placed on its table. The display is distributed over the classroom, the information being spatially associated to each group. We are now comparing these two versions in an empirical study with two first year undergraduate classes in Physics. Preliminary results show that both versions increase the efficiency of interaction between students and teaching assistants.

The model is used in the current study to translate music into discrete vibration signals displayed along the back of the body using a chair form factor. Voice coils facilitate the direct translation of auditory information onto the multiple discrete vibrotactile channels, which increases the potential to identify sections of the music that would otherwise be masked by the combined signal. One of the central goals of this work has been to improve accessibility to the emotional information expressed in music for users who are Deaf or hard of hearing. To this end, we present our prototype of the MHC, two models of sensory substitution to support the translation of existing and new music, and some of the design challenges encountered throughout the development process. Results of a series of experiments conducted to assess the effectiveness of the MHC are discussed, followed by an overview of future directions for this research.",Citations: 66,,en

Ubiquitous sensing systems have the potential to sense everyday behaviors and provide the objective feedback necessary for self-regulation of medication taking. We describe an unobtrusive sensing system consisting of a sensor-augmented pillbox and an ambient display that provides near real-time visual feedback about how well medications are being taken. In contrast to other systems that focus on reminding before medication taking, our approach uses feedback after medication taking to allow the individual to develop their own routines through selfregulation. We evaluated this system in the homes of older adults in a 10-month deployment. Feedback helped improve the consistency of medication-taking behaviors as well as increased ratings of self-efficacy. However, the improved performance did not persist after the feedback display was removed, because individuals had integrated the feedback display into their routines to support their self-awareness, identify mistakes, guide the timing of medication taking, and provide a sense of security that they are taking their medications well. Finally, we reflect on design considerations for feedback systems to support the process of self-regulation of everyday behaviors.",Citations: 66,978-1-4503-2473-1,en

The service was evaluated in a within-subjects experiment, where groups of participants discussed topics of general interest, with a total of 82 participants. It was found that the presence of the feedback about speaking time influenced the behaviour of the participants in such a way that it made over-participators to behave less dominant and under-participators to become more active.

In addition there is a need to provide abstract information, in context, to local and remote stakeholders. There are many different viewing options utilizing converged networks and the resulting explosion in data and information has resulted in a new problem, as these new ambient assisted living services struggle to convey meaningful information to different groups of end users.

While these systems are targeted at supporting the individual driver and his or her safety, they may though compete for the driver’s attention, and may demand too much of the driver’s cognitive resources. Based on the established multiple resource theory in recent years, the use of different multimodal displays has been investigated that give the driver attention while not overloading sensory channels. In our work, we are looking into peripheral light displays in means to present safety relevant information. In this paper, we present the results of an experiment in which a peripheral light display was used to show the distance to a closing vehicle. The display is an LED stripe, seamlessly integrated into the side door and the dashboard of the car. Two different light patterns were tested in an overtaking scenario in a driving simulator. One pattern encodes the expected time to collision to the left rear car by moving a light source towards the front left corner. The other pattern additionally adapts its brightness to a simplified model of the driver’s certainty to get his or her attention in uncertain situations. In contrast to previous works, we did not focus on a warning system but on a decision aid system. We found that using the adaptive pattern led to faster decisions and therefore to a smaller probability of violating safety distances. We believe that this pattern is a good basis for patterns which are fine-tuned to individual drivers as well as better driver models.",Citations: 47,978-1-4503-3736-6,en

This mechanism, however, heavily relies on users setting their own state correctly. In an online survey with 46 participants we found that neglecting state updates leads to unwanted messages, either because the state is incorrect or others disrespect it because they assume it to be wrong anyway. We address this situation with the StaTube, a tangible object offering (1) peripheral interaction for setting one’s own state and (2) peripheral awareness of selected others’ state. In an in-situ evaluation we found first indicators that (1) peripheral interaction fosters more frequent state updates and more accurate state information, and (2) that our participants felt more aware of their contacts’ states due to the physical ambient representation.",Citations: 47,,en

We reiterate arguments for and against using critical parameters to characterize user goals and usability artifacts. Responding to residual arguments, we suggest that clear advantages for research cohesion, design knowledge reuse, and HCI education are possible if several challenges are overcome. As a first step, we recommend a slight variation to the concept of a critical parameter, which would allow both abstract and concrete knowledge representation. With this concept, we demonstrate a feasible approach by introducing equations that elaborate and allow evolution of notification system critical parameters, which is made operational with a variety of usability evaluation instruments. A case study illustrates how one general instrument allowed system designs to be meaningfully compared and resulted in valuable inferences for interface reengineering. Broad implications and conclusions about this approach will be of interest to others concerned with using critical parameters in interface design, development of notification systems interfaces, or approaches to design rationale and knowledge reuse.",Citations: 40,,en

However, the drawback of graphical navigation displays is that drivers have to explicitly glance at them, which can distract from a situation on the road. To decrease driver distraction while driving with a navigation system, we explore the use of ambient light as a navigation aid in the car, in order to shift navigation aids to the periphery of human attention. We investigated this by conducting studies in a driving simulator, where we found that drivers spent significantly less time glancing at the ambient light navigation aid than on a GUI navigation display. Moreover, ambient light-based navigation was perceived to be easy to use and understand, and preferred over traditional GUI navigation displays. We discuss the implications of these outcomes on automotive personal navigation devices.",Citations: 39,978-1-4503-4408-1,en

We describe the system properties and the perceptual components. Also, we present a study aimed at evaluating the effect of such a system on meeting behaviour. Groups of participants, amounting to 82 participants in all, discussed topics of general interest. Analysis of the data of 58 participants showed that feedback influenced the behaviour of the participants in such a way that it made over-participators speak less and underparticipators speak more. Analysis of the micro-patterns of six participants indicated that feedback on gaze behaviour had little effect on the interaction dynamics.

We consider design for experience, an orthogonal dimension to task-centric home life. TM produces abstract visualizations on a large LCD every few minutes, driven by a set of four overhead cameras that capture a sense of the social life of a domestic space. The openness and ambiguity of TM allow for a cycle of co-interpretation with householders. We report on three longitudinal deployments of TM for a period of six weeks. Participant families engaged with TM at the outset to understand how their behaviors were influencing the machine, and, while TM remained puzzling, householders interacted richly with TM and its images.

AAL systems provide health monitoring through sensor based technologies to preserve health and functional ability and facilitate social support for the ageing population. Human activity recognition (HAR) is an enabler for the development of robust AAL solutions, especially in safety critical environments. Therefore, HAR models applied within this domain (e.g. for fall detection or for providing contextual information to caregivers) need to be accurate to assist in developing reliable support systems. In this paper, we evaluate three machine learning algorithms, namely Support Vector Machine (SVM), a hybrid of Hidden Markov Models (HMM) and SVM (SVM-HMM) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) applied on a dataset collected between the elderly and their caregiver counterparts. Detected activities will later serve as inputs to a bidirectional activity awareness system for increasing social connectedness. Results show high classification performances for all three algorithms. Specifically, the SVMHMM hybrid demonstrates the best classification performance.

To enable the user to align their behavior with the dynamics of the energy generation they need to be informed about the current status of power supply and grid capacity. Furthermore, to be able to plan their behavior and possibly delay or advance consumption activities to more proper moments they also need to have access to high-quality forecasts about the future status of green energy supply.

However, social learning, inspiration and collaboration between coworkers do not come naturally. In particular in (semi-) public spaces, the behavioural norm among unacquainted coworkers is to work in individual silos without taking advantage of social learning or collaboration opportunities. This paper presents results from a pilot study of ‘Gelatine’ – a system that facilitates shared encounters between coworkers by allowing them to digitally ‘check in’ at a work space. Gelatine displays skills, areas of interest, and needs of currently present coworkers on a public screen. The results indicate that the system amplifies users’ sense of place and awareness of other coworkers, and serves as an interface for social learning through exploratory, opportunistic and serendipitous inspirations, as well as through helping users identify like-minded peers for follow-up face-toface encounters. We discuss how Gelatine is perceived by users with different pre-entry motivations, and discuss users’ challenges as well as non-use of the system.",Citations: 35,,en

Dazzle was very effective at grounding team conversations about user research, but was used less for sharing information during brainstorming tasks.

In nine anaesthesia test scenarios, participants were asked every 50–70 s whether one of five vital signs was abnormal and the trend of its direction. Abnormality judgements were unaffected by music or musical training. Trend judgements were more accurate when music was playing (p = 0.0004). Musical participants reported trends more accurately (p = 0.004), and non-musical participants tended to benefit more from music than did the musical participants (p = 0.063). Music may provide a pitch and rhythm standard from which participants can judge changes in vital signs from auditory displays.

Having the displays operate at the periphery of a user's attention allows other user tasks to sustain primary. Much like the information presented by wallclocks, posters, paintings or windows, peripheral displays move to the center of attention only when appropriate and desirable. Abstract art has been proposed to serve as the visualization paradigm, encoding information into graphical or pictorial artwork by subtly modifying its shape, color and appearance details or its overall impression. This paper approaches a systematic elaboration of visual metaphors able to deliver information via peripheral displays in an aesthetic, artful way. In our approach, the choice of metaphors is driven by the aesthetic appeal of the visual appearance of the display as a whole, out of which certain dynamic emblems or symbols are used to conotate information in a visual style. From experiments we find, that such metaphors are considered by users as a means of personal emotional expression, and that controllable aesthetic attractiveness turns out to be the dominant factor of display appreciation. The choice of aesthetic themes, as well as the control of emblem and symbol dynamics are supported and implemented in our peripheral display framework, a general purpose software framework for informative art display systems.",,978-3-540-73280-8 978-3-540-73281-5,en

In order to guarantee that the stimuli would not require the subjects focal attention, the vibration pattern was tested and refined to minimise its obtrusiveness, and during the study, the participants adjusted its intensity to just above their personal detection threshold. At random times, the vibration stopped and participants had to acknowledge these events as soon as they noticed them. Only 6.5\% of the events were acknowledged fast enough to assume that the cue had been on the focus of the participants’ attention. The majority of events were answered between 1 and 10 minutes, which indicates that the participants were aware of the cue without focussing on it. In addition, participants reported not to be annoyed by the signal in 94.4\% of the events.

One approach toward enhancing technology design for experience is to identify aspects missing from existing computer models, such as emotion, creativity, spirituality, and add these missing components to the equation. Another approach attempts not to fit complex experiences into computer models but looks at alternate uses of technology for drawing attention to the complexity of meaningmaking experiences. This second approach is introduced through the work of the Affective Presence consortium and advances the idea of design as a process of co-construction between users, systems, and designers.

It is also customizable and programmable to an extent. Sylvain Huet developed most of the embedded code of all Violet objects. Sebastien Bourdeauducq developed the Wi-Fi driver. Antoine Schmitt has been their behavior designer and Jean-Jacques Birgé their sound designer (together they have also composed Nabaz'mob, an opera for 100 Nabaztag). Maÿlis Puyfaucher (who features its French voice) wrote all the original texts pronounced by the rabbit. On 20 October 2009, following a long period of technical difficulties that ultimately led to Violet's bankruptcy, Mindscape purchased Violet.In October 2010, Mindscape announced a third generation Nabaztag, called ""Karotz"". Karotz was released April 2012.

We present a novel algorithm based on multi-label graph cut for segmenting video into temporally coherent region maps. These maps are used to both stylize video into cartoons and paintings, and measure visual similarity between frames for smooth sequence transitions. The system automatically structures the media collection into a hierarchical representation based on visual content and semantics. Graph optimization is applied to adaptively sequence content for display in a coarse-to-fine manner, driven by user attention level (detected in real-time by a webcam). Our system is deployed on embedded hardware in the form of a compact digital photo frame. We demonstrate coherent segmentation and stylization over a variety of home videos and photos.

We further introduce three distinct categories that denote potential application domains for ceiling-based data visualizations. Finally, we present four different application scenarios we have developed using prototyping and user-centered design techniques, and discuss how they relate to the categories.",Citations: 14,,en

The main research questions were whether an attention-aware display design can capture the user’s focus of attention and whether this has an influence on the knowledge gain. A display prototype corresponding to the main ambient display characteristics was designed, applied in a controlled authentic setting, and evaluated accordingly. The prototype presented information and guidelines for first responders in emergency situations, especially in cases of cardiac arrest. The prototype was enhanced with a custom-built sensor to measure user attention and trigger interruptive notifications. The study was conducted among 52 employees working at a university campus. Using an experimental research design, a treatment group exposed to an attention-aware display design was compared to a control group. The results provide evidence that such a display design can attract and retain attention in such a way that the acquisition of knowledge (i.e. the comprehension of the presented information) is effectively facilitated.",Citations: 13,,en

We propose a dynamic Bayesian network model to infer the focus of attention, which models the relation between multiple foci of attention, multiple user locations and faces captured by the multiple cameras in the environment. Head pose is not explicitly computed but measured by a similarity vector which represents the likelihoods of multiple face clusters.

This model is useful to clarify conceptual relationships between different visualization design approaches, ranging from traditional data representation applications over to ambient displays to visualization art experiences.

In attempt to help people feel more connected, we designed and created BodyPods, a remotely paired set of communicating chairs that facilitate a sense of presence by leveraging implicit actions such as sitting to communicate that someone you care about is home. Each BodyPod consists of a flexible surface with six pressure-sensitive and light-emitting pads that adjusts its shape to the body anatomy. As a person’s body moves, limbs exert different pressure on each pad creating a live digital “bodyprint” that is mapped on the pads of other BodyPods through color and light.

Ambient projection could enable any suitable surface in an environment to be employed as a display device. Using such displays, the intelligent environment could present high-resolution information, proactively alert users who are not carrying handheld devices and annotate objects in the environment without instrumentation.

Our current prototype is a bag built out of the system that understands it is a bag when the handle is attached to the mesh of modules, responds by illuminating its fabric and inner contents when the sun goes down (Fig 1), communicates the presence of objects placed in the bag, and interacts with the user via speech.

In this paper, we envision a new method, LightTouch, by which a wearable can establish a secure connection to an ambient display, such as a television or a computer monitor, while ensuring the user’s intention to connect to the display. LightTouch uses standard RF methods (like Bluetooth) for communicating the data to display, securely bootstrapped via the visible-light communication (the brightness channel) from the display to the low-cost, low-power, ambient light sensor of a wearable. A screen ‘touch’ gesture is adopted by users to ensure that the modulation of screen brightness can be securely captured by the ambient light sensor with minimized noise. Wireless coordination with the processor driving the display establishes a shared secret based on the brightness channel information. We further propose novel onscreen localization and correlation algorithms to improve security and reliability. Through experiments and a preliminary user study we demonstrate that LightTouch is compatible with current display and wearable designs, is easy to use (about 6 seconds to connect), is reliable (up to 98\% success connection ratio), and is secure against attacks.",,978-1-5090-5336-0,en

However, how to address awareness at user perception level represents a challenge for which little progress has been made so far in contrast with considerable advances in designing interaction techniques for such displays. Even though many interactive ambient displays exist with properly designed interfaces, people may not always be aware of their interactivity. This work addresses the problem of interactivity awareness by focusing on two important questions: How can people tell whether a public display is interactive or not? and, assuming interactivity, How can people tell what the interface is? A study was conducted in order to investigate factors potentially related to perceived interactivity. Results show that people’s evaluations are correct in most cases but they also tend to form incorrect perceptions in many other situations. We found that location, installation, reachability, and displayed content are factors that can influence people’s perceptions. Our findings are complemented with a discussion of techniques that can be used in the practice of designing for interactivity awareness.",Citations: 10,,en

Considering these characteristics of elders, we propose Ambient Information Systems (AIS) as the appropriate technology to assist elders, since they are aesthetically pleasing applications which provide users with abstract representations of valued information. The aim of this work was to identify the design issues that should be addressed for developing AIS that effectively assist elderly with their ADLs. To reach this end, we designed mobile and embedded AIS that help elderly to manage their medication, since it is one of the critical ADLs for enabling “ageing in place”.

Like data-art or visual and auditory art-forms driven by data content directly mapped to their rendering, sonification shares the goal of aesthetic representation (auditory graphing) in a way to better and more accessibly convey the message to broader consumer audiences. Often, the simple re-contextualization of dense abstract data in an auditory graph (or sonification) is sufficient to highlight long-term trends, to hear regularities (patterns) and anomalies in periodicity of time-series data and to assimilate very subtle and fine transformations. Sonification is also optimal for certain working or ambient situations that are visually rich or visually saturated, when we seek to command topical and peripheral attention with relevant cues. Auditory display is also an alternative to visualization for people with visual impairments. Exploring the premise that sonification should be both aesthetic and informative, i.e. listenable, attractive and engaging, this paper summarises the findings of 3 experiments conducted to determine ways to better represent and access dense information mapped on to more than one concurrent stream of information. Specifically, we show evidence that spatialization of informative events coinciding in time can be more clearly distinguished and that timbre (or tone colour / tone quality) characteristics can serve to further reinforce spatial and stream separation. These findings combine to develop comprehensible methods for representing complex data-sets.

The main idea is that a user interface would react onto its user and would execute reactions on his/her actions. Main problem with creating ambient user interface is that for different domains the human-computer interaction changes. In this article we investigate different tools that are employed in ambient user interface and the different approaches how they are used. We focus mainly on the use of the multi-display set-up, touch screens, kinect, eye-tracking devices and brain-computer interface technology. We propose approaches how they can be utilized in an ambient user interface, how they affect the user and how they can be used for the evaluation of ambient user interface. It is essential for future research that these measures evaluate the efficiency of the use of ambient user interface in different domains. We briefly analyze natural user interface and its association to ambient user interface. In the conclusion we establish the steps for the future research of this topic.",Citations: 9,,en

Due to the fact that ambient displays should be unobtrusive, it is hard for users to appraise them on a reflective level (i.e. interviews and questionnaires). In this paper we present a methodological approach that combines an implicit (the Affect Misattribution Procedure (AMP)) and an explicit measurement technique (questionnaire for the persuasive effect (PeQ)) to tackle this problem. We used this approach in a study of an interface (Operator Guide) that provides information to operators in a semiconductor factory. Results show that the implicit technique is better suited to assess fine attitudinal differences on how users experience the display than explicit questionnaires. However, explicit measures are valuable to gain suggestions for improvements and thus it is concluded that this method triangulation adds value for the research on ambient persuasive interfaces.",Citations: 9,978-3-642-34897-6 978-3-642-34898-3,en

If it can be aesthetically interesting, that is an added bonus. Recent research experiments with reversing this imperative. An information display, which is first - aesthetically pleasing and second - is able to display information, is designed and implemented. The display presents an e-mail title in a visual form as a collage of images - each image corresponding to one or more words. It next filters the collage through aesthetic properties specified by an artist, such as colors, texture, and shape. This filter renders the original collage as a pleasing art. We propose an extension of this work by: adding a voice activation module; displaying information of user’s request (versus displaying e-mail titles only); and presenting the display in a form of a decorative digital painting hanging on the wall. The advantages of this approach are: being ambient - in a sense of: entering person’s attention when needed, and largely disappearing into the environment when not needed; and being interactive - as in providing information per user’s interest through speech recognition. This produces new interactive, ambient system for aesthetic information display on user’s demand.",,,en

Based on the results of the study, we present a working prototype of a plantxel that is composed of a plant, the air-based stimulation system, and the control logic. The prototype allowed us to assess the effectiveness of our design choices, and to outline some potential limitations. Finally, we discuss the possibilities of using such plant-based display for dynamic information visualization in public spaces and provide directions for future work.",Citations: 8,978-1-4503-5765-4,en

Many humans, however, spend the bulk of their day sitting still instead. On average, for instance an adult spends approximately 10 hours each day sitting–in Asia, Europe as well as US. While a brief period of sitting here and there is natural, long periods of sitting day-in and day-out can seriously impact health and are associated with a significantly higher risk of heart disease, diabetes, obesity, cancer, and depression, as well as muscle and joint problems. Even working out vigorously may not compensate for long sitting sessions. The key is to build frequent movement variety into the day and to change the sitting position from time to time. About every 20-30 minutes the body needs a posture break by moving for a couple of minutes or, at least, by changing the sitting position.",Citations: 8,978-1-4503-6363-1,en

The main challenges for finding such balance lie in the acquisition of availability information from the interruptee and its delivery to the interrupter. In this demonstration, we show how common technical approaches in ubicomp can address some of the problems typically encountered in availability sharing. We present InterruptMe, a novel availability sharing system that uses sensor information to calculate multiple availability measures for each interruptee and that delivers this information in the periphery of the interrupter’s attention by using a projected peripheral display and monitoring implicit inputs to the system.",Citations: 7,978-1-4503-0630-0,en

In this paper, we present the OpenMessenger Framework, a system and design framework rooted in the assumption that individual behaviors occur in anticipation of and/or in response to the behavior of others. We describe both the system architecture, and specific examples of the novel implementations it enables. These include techniques for coupling gathering behaviors with display behaviors, and for integrating these into user workspaces via peripheral displays and gaze tracking.",Citations: 7,,en

We also examine 36 previously reported Ambient Information Systems and categorise them in terms of an existing taxonomy of design patterns for such systems. A benefit of this taxonomy approach is that it helps us identify an underutilised design area for these displays and leads us to propose a new design pattern, known as the “Aesthetic Awareness Display” to assist in the design of these systems.

Although people are surrounded by flora and fauna, nature is often hidden and difficult to learn about. Birds are active outside when many people are indoors, seen but not heard, or heard but not seen. So, can technologies play a role in reconnecting us to and through nature? This project researches how to learn about local birds in a non-intrusive, fun calm and engaging manner. The Ambient Birdhouse sits inside the house and plays media of local birds - sometimes giving clues about them. Bird houses are connected. You can share bird media from your phone of your own sightings, challenging a neighbour to identify them. Known calls are interspersed with environmental sound to foster listening and developing an ear for local birds. The Ambient Birdhouse follows principles of ambient interaction. It poses the design research challenge of how to engage people in a gentle, social way over time to build awareness of nature, bringing it back into our lives.",Citations: 5,978-1-4503-4991-8,en

The photographs of up to four users are displayed in a dynamic collage in the four quadrants of a dedicated ambient display, with photographs to each quadrant arriving in real time as photographs are taken/uploaded. Historical photos can also be browsed or played back in lockstep with each other, as a reminder of what each member of the group was doing over the same period of time. The system was trailed over seven weeks by an extended family distributed over three countries. The findings suggest that the system increases the social connection and presence between children, parents and grandparents of an intergenerational family living apart. This was not only through ’visual status’ images of family members living in different places, but also through updates of collocated members travelling away from home, and deliberately crafted images designed to elicit responses or trigger discussions in other media.

It uses this information to adjust the level of detail of the displayed information. If the user is far from the display, a black-and-white image is displayed that does not attract attention. But when the user’s approach is recognized, the display provides three-dimensional spatial navigation through the image space. When the user is very close to the display, they can interact directly using the touch screen. In the event of an emergency, LEDs attached around the display call the user’s attention by flashing the light.",,978-3-540-73280-8 978-3-540-73281-5,en

In this paper, we demonstrate interaction criticism as an approach to design research, exploring and proposing reasons for the product’s decline. Specifically, we argue that the rabbit is difficult to connect with emotionally and explore several reasons this might be true. Our approach is phenomenological and hermeneutic in nature: we engaged in product usage for over twelve months, and practice a theoretically informed interpretive analysis. Using a combination of critical theories and affect research from robotics, we argue the Nabaztag product identity is confusing, which might be related to the manufactures’ multiple intentions, and the gap between ideal and real users. We continue with an account of two genres of functions in the Nabaztag, revealing how they polarize of interpretation; moments when Nabaztag acted in unexpected ways; and the increased, rather than decreased, difficulty in interpreting Nabaztag the longer we used it. Interpretively understanding Nabaztag’s experiential failures helps cultivate relevant design sensitivities and even implications for future designs.",Citations: 5,,en

A Microsoft Kinect-based tracking system is employed to detect users’ presence. Follow the Grass can be used for entertainment purposes by displaying animations through movement of the grass, as well as for indoor way-finding and ambient persuasive guidance. We present a number of scenarios with varying scales of interaction, and different applications, followed by a description of the initial hardware design of a single blade of grass and its actuated root.

Recently, the technology to change behavior of people implicitly based on computer-generated ancient information and stimulations that prompts physical senses to have been studied in virtual reality. These studies aim to adopt their behavior to their surrounding environment mainly. The technologies to adopt their behavior to the individual in the context of his/her psychological state have not really investigated. We focused on comic book images as ambient information. The creative use of image of background in comic have an ability to describe and communicate various psychological states or situation of characters in the comic. We hypothesized that communicating of comic book images that describes personal psychological states enable us to understand the state and induce the preferred behavior in real world. Based on the hypothesis, we construct a system named “Psynteraction Chair,” which is a system to estimate and present psychological states of a user using comic book images to people around of the user. “Psynteraction Chair” estimates the level of concentration of the user. A comic book image which represents the most suitable psychological state is projected on the back of the chair based on the level of user's concentration.

Each pixel unit includes a microcontroller, RF transceiver (433 MHz), LED module (ten bright, white LEDs), rechargeable Li-Ion battery pack, IR sensor and renewable energy source such as photo-voltaic cells. Two acrylic half-spheres (4inch diameter) protect the components from the elements. No additional wiring is needed for communication and the units can be mounted individually to any surface. A smallscale prototype network of fifty Urban Pixels was displayed on a façade of Eden Court Theater in Inverness, Scotland from June 1 – June 7, 2008.

In addition, many health issues can be traced back to bad indoor room-climate. However, especially in Europe, pupils spend a majority of their learning life in school classes affected by poor room climate. Without an automatic heating, ventilation and air conditioning system these pupils and their teachers have to rely on manual ventilation by opening windows. Thereby, they often lack fundamental room climate quality information to effectively guide their behavior. Information systems (IS) and sensor technology can be a remedy to these challenges. Existing room climate monitoring systems regularly reveal major shortcomings, e.g. in respect to user interfaces, presentation of data, and systematic engagement. We want to address the aforementioned shortcomings and present an art IS, which reflects room conditions in real time through modifications of depicted art. The artifact is evaluated in a field experiment, conducted in an Austrian grammar school. The evaluation reveals that room climate measured in CO2 can indeed be improved significantly.

Users are given a subtle hint with abstract ambient information via messaging in an ambient public situation and are identified through an RFID on a tag inside the detection-zone. They can then read personal messages by actively manipulating the ID tag using gesture-based controls inside the interaction zone. To develop the Ambient Widget device, a tri-axis acceleration sensor was embedded into an ID tag, and seven different gesture interactions with the ID tag were classified to control events for message navigation. Ambient Widget was installed in the lobby area of an international conference so that the participants can communicate through AIS instead of the usual messaging boards.

We consider the latter information in particular to be of great importance. These two data feeds are communicated via LEDs placed at the top and base of the device, along with aural output to indicate volcanic eruption warning levels. We also created a simple web interface for this information. By creating this device and application, we aim to reimagine how geospatial information can be presented, while also creating something which is visually appealing.

Still, there are occasions where intentions are not retained when external memory aids are used due to the aid’s inability to convey task information or cue execution of a task. In our work, we look to design an external memory aid that supports retention of individual task knowledge as well as retention of task knowledge in a user’s different areas of responsibility.

We developed iFlit –an interactive and collective ambient display that enables a group of students to reflect on their burnout level, and sleeping and activity habits. iFlit shows a garden with birds representing students monitored behaviour. Birds move according to users’ activity level, and the garden’s background changes according to each user’s sleeping habits. Users match peers perceived burnout, and sleep and activity habits to induce cognitive dissonance. We argue such displays are more efficient than personal devices to empower individuals’ self-reflection due their capabilities for enabling a playful interaction with their personal data.",,,en

The ambient display can identify the user and measure how far away they are using an RFID reader and ultrasonic sensors. When the user is a long way from the display, it acts as a digital picture and does not attract attention. When the user comes within an appropriate range for interaction, the display shows pictures that are related to the user and provides quasi-3D navigation using the TIP (tour into the picture) method.

While numerous studies investigate real-time participatory engagement of fans on Twitter, athletes’ use of Twitter during competition remains underexplored. Using a case study approach, this study brings together computermediated discourse analysis and prior work on involvement in discourse to examine tweets posted during competitive events by two endurance athletes (an experienced amateur marathon runner and an elite rock climber). Specifically, it explores how athletes mobilize various linguistic strategies to create relations of connectedness, or ambient affiliation (Zappavigna, 2011), with their respective audiences who are distanced spatially and often temporally. It also demonstrates how the affordances and limitations of technology, and the constraints of the athletic events themselves, shape ambient involvement. In this way, this work adds to our understanding of how ambient affiliation is constructed in a particular context – a competitive athletic event of an endurance athlete practicing a solitary sport – while also shedding light on how involvement is created and maintained with a largely unknown online audience.",,,en

Personal care of the elderly is of concern to their relatives, in case they are alone in their homes and unforeseen circumstances occur, affecting their wellbeing. The alternative; i.e. care in nursing homes or hospitals is costly and increases further if specialized care is mobilized to patients' place of residence. Enabling technologies for independent living by the elderly such as the ambient assisted living systems (AALS) are seen as essential to enhancing care in a cost-effective manner. In light of significant advances in telecommunication, computing and sensor miniaturization, as well as the ubiquity of mobile and connected devices embodying the concept of the Internet of Things (IoT), end-to-end solutions for ambient assisted living have become a reality. The premise of such applications is the continuous and most often real-time monitoring of the environment and occupant behavior using an event-driven intelligent system, thereby providing a facility for monitoring and assessment, and triggering assistance as and when needed. As a growing area of research, it is essential to investigate the approaches for developing AALS in literature to identify current practices and directions for future research. This paper is, therefore, aimed at a comprehensive and critical review of the frameworks and sensor systems used in various ambient assisted living systems, as well as their objectives and relationships with care and clinical systems. Findings from our work suggest that most frameworks focused on activity monitoring for assessing immediate risks, while the opportunities for integrating environmental factors for analytics and decision-making, in particular for the long-term care were often overlooked. The potential for wearable devices and sensors, as well as distributed storage and access (e.g. cloud) are yet to be fully appreciated. There is a distinct lack of strong supporting clinical evidence from the implemented technologies. Socio-cultural aspects such as divergence among groups, acceptability and usability of AALS were also overlooked. Future systems need to look into the issues of privacy and cyber security.",Citations: 83,,

For example, we are aware of what the weather is like and we can routinely wash our hands without actively thinking about it. However, we can also easily focus on these activities when desired. Contrarily, interactions with computing devices, such as smartphones and tablet computers, usually require focused attention, or even demand it through flashing displays, beeping sounds, and vibrations used to alert people. Hence, these interactions move more unpredictably between periphery and center of attention compared to non-computer-mediated activities. With the number of computers embedded in our everyday environment increasing, inevitably interaction with these computers will move to the periphery of attention. Inspired by the way we fluently divide our attentional resources over various activities in everyday life, we call this type of interaction “peripheral interaction.” We believe that considering and enabling peripheral interaction with computing technology contributes to more seamlessly embedding of such technology in everyday routines.

However, especially in a mobile context, it can be difficult to have truly continuous indicators that are not fatiguing, annoying, or consuming considerable power. We propose “pseudo-ambient” displays that are not continuous, yet are nearly always accessible since they are triggered at regular intervals. Our contention is that such displays can potentially provide most of the benefits of a fully continuous ambient display, with limited drawbacks.

The encoded images are visible only to cameras synchronized with the projectors and exposed for a short interval, while the original images appear only minimally degraded to the human eye. To achieve this goal, we analyze and exploit the micro-mirror modulation pattern used by the projection technology to generate intensity levels for each pixel and color channel. Our real-time embedding process maps the user's original color image values to the nearest values whose camera-perceived intensities are the ones desired by the binary image to be embedded. The color differences caused by this mapping process are compensated by error-diffusion dithering. The non-intrusive nature of our approach allows simultaneous (immersive) display and acquisition under controlled lighting conditions, as defined on a pixel level by the binary patterns. We therefore introduce structured light techniques into human-inhabited mixed and augmented reality environments, where they previously often were too intrusive.",Citations: 175,,

The current study aimed to further explore the role of experience as a key factor in the potential narrowing of spatial attention, and the possibility of differences in the time course of attentional deployment. It was predicted that the amount of narrowing due to central processing demands would change as a function of driving experience, with more experienced drivers suffering less narrowing due to their mastery of central processing demands in road scenes. The data did not support the narrowing hypothesis, though they did support the alternative strategic difference between the driver groups in the time-course of attentional deployment.

One challenge that remains in this emerging research field is the ability to enhance the behavior of any application by informing it of the context of its use. By context, we refer to any information that characterizes a situation related to the interaction between humans, applications, and the surrounding environment. Context-aware applications promise richer and easier interaction, but the current state of research in this field is still far removed from that vision. This is due to 3 main problems: (a) the notion of context is still ill defined, (b) there is a lack of conceptual models and methods to help drive the design of context-aware applications, and (c) no tools are available to jump-start the development of context-aware applications. In this anchor article, we address these 3 problems in turn. We first define context, identify categories of contextual information, and characterize context-aware application behavior. Though the full impact of context-aware computing requires understanding very subtle and high-level notions of context, we are focusing our efforts on the pieces of context that can be inferred automatically from sensors in a physical environment. We then present a conceptual framework that separates the acquisition and representation of context from the delivery and reaction to context by a context-aware application. We have built a toolkit, the Context Toolkit, that instantiates this conceptual framework and supports the rapid development of a rich space of context-aware applications. We illustrate the usefulness of the conceptual framework by describing a number of context-aware applications that have been prototyped using the Context Toolkit.

This paper investigates an approach to ambient sonification that activates everyday interactions, by using sensors to pick up interactions that users make with physical objects in a domestic environment. These actions are then used to trigger or control ambient sonifications. These sonifications are based on the information obtained from the same sensors or from information sourced from data services. The design patterns and implementation concerns are discussed and several prototype sonifications presented.",Citations: 9,,en

Moreover, these approaches often neglect how people actually use their physical space. The concept of Activity Zones defines the environmental context by regions of similar user activities and can be learned by observing human behavior.

Based on recent findings from embodied cognition and cognitive linguistics, Blended Interaction provides a novel and more accurate description of the nature of human–computer interaction (\{HCI).\} In particular, it introduces the notion of conceptual blends to explain how users rely on familiar and real-world concepts whenever they learn to use new digital technologies. We apply Blended Interaction in the context of post-\{“Windows\} Icons Menu Pointer” interactive spaces. These spaces are ubiquitous computing environments for computer-supported collaboration of multiple users in a physical space or room, e.g., meeting rooms, design studios, or libraries, augmented with novel interactive technologies and digital computation, e.g., multi-touch walls, tabletops, and tablets. Ideally, in these spaces, the virtues of the familiar physical and social world are combined with that of the digital realm in a considered manner so that desired properties of each are preserved and a seemingly “natural” \{HCI\} is achieved. To support designers in this goal, we explain how the users' conceptual systems use blends to tie together familiar concepts with the novel powers of digital computation. Furthermore, we introduce four domains of design to structure the underlying problem and design space: individual and social interaction, workflow, and physical environment. We introduce our framework by discussing related work, e.g., metaphors, mental models, direct manipulation, image schemas, reality-based interaction, and illustrate Blended Interaction using design decisions we made in recent projects.",Citations: 98,,

The basic idea is to use real-time computer vision techniques to dynamically extract per-pixel depth and reflectance information for the visible surfaces in the office including walls, furniture, objects, and people, and then to either project images on the surfaces, render images of the surfaces , or interpret changes in the surfaces. In the first case, one could designate every-day (potentially irregular) real surfaces in the office to be used as spatially immersive display surfaces, and then project high-resolution graphics and text onto those surfaces. In the second case, one could transmit the dynamic image-based models over a network for display at a remote site. Finally, one could interpret dynamic changes in the surfaces for the purposes of tracking, interaction, or augmented reality applications. To accomplish the simultaneous capture and display we envision an office of the future where the ceiling lights are replaced by computer controlled cameras and “smart” projectors that are used to capture dynamic image-based models with imperceptible structured light techniques, and to display high-resolution images on designated display surfaces. By doing both simultaneously on the designated display surfaces, one can dynamically adjust or autocalibrate for geometric, intensity, and resolution variations resulting from irregular or changing display surfaces, or overlapped projector images. Our current approach to dynamic image-based modeling is to use an optimized structured light scheme that can capture per-pixel depth and reflectance at interactive rates. Our system implementation is not yet imperceptible, but we can demonstrate the approach in the laboratory. Our approach to rendering on the designated (potentially irregular) display surfaces is to employ a two-pass projective texture scheme to generate images that when projected onto the surfaces appear correct to a moving head- tracked observer. We present here an initial implementation of the overall vision, in an office-like setting, and preliminary demonstrations of our dynamic modeling and display techniques.",Citations: 1090,,

LightSit comprises a sensor mat that can be embedded into an office chair for measuring a user’s sitting posture and heart rate variability and a lighting display that is integrated into a monitor stand to present information unobtrusively, facilitating fitness and relaxation exercises during microbreaks. Following the showroom approach, we evaluated LightSit during a public exhibition at Dutch Design Week 2018. During the eight days of the exhibition, we observed more than 500 sessions of experiences with healthy microbreaks using our prototype. Semistructured interviews were conducted with 50 participants who had office-based jobs and had experienced LightSit. Our qualitative findings indicated the potential benefits of LightSit in facilitating health-promoting behaviors during office work. Based on the insights learned from this study, we discuss the implications for future designs of interactive health-promoting systems.",Citations: 8,,en

One promising approach for providing feedback about residential energy consumption is the use of ambient and artistic visualizations. Pervasive computing technologies enable the integration of such feedback into the home in the form of distributed point-of-consumption feedback devices to support decision-making in everyday activities. However, introducing these devices into the home requires sensitivity to the domestic context. In this paper we describe three abstract visualizations and suggest four design requirements that this type of device must meet to be effective: pragmatic, aesthetic, ambient, and ecological. We report on the findings from a mixed methods user study that explores the viability of using ambient and artistic feedback in the home based on these requirements. Our findings suggest that this approach is a viable way to provide resource use feedback and that both the aesthetics of the representation and the context of use are important elements that must be considered in this design space.",Citations: 116,,en

We then examine various approaches for measuring cognitive load before describing a study that investigates a novel use of a dual-task measure to evaluate the cognitive load of a specific Ambient Display. A betweensubjects design with 40 participants was used, with the Ambient Display active for half of these participants. All participants completed three different primary tasks (n-back, visual digit span, and auditory digit span) alongside the secondary, Detection Response Task. The results show that the n-back task is the most appropriate for manipulating primary task load when evaluating such displays and that the dual-task paradigm can be used to provide an objective measure of workload.

We present a system to breathe life into home video repositories, drawing upon artistic stylization to create a “Digital Ambient Display” that automatically selects, stylizes and transitions between videos in a semantically meaningful sequence. We present a novel algorithm based on multi-label graph cut for segmenting video into temporally coherent region maps. These maps are used to both stylize video into cartoons and paintings, and measure visual similarity between frames for smooth sequence transitions.

Through the design of the DeLight system, we aim to establish a biofeedback-driven lighting environment that informs users about their stress level for intervention and assists them in biofeedback relaxation training. In this study, DeLight is interfaced with a heart rate variability biofeedback system with two modes for different purposes: stress intervention and relaxation assistance. We evaluated the prototype of DeLight in two user studies. The results of the first study show that DeLight has the potential for stress intervention; the HRV biofeedback through the changes of ambient light could improve a user’s awareness of stress and trigger behavioral conditioning, such as deep breathing. The results of the second study confirm that DeLight has potential as a new biofeedback interface for relaxation assistance; biofeedback through an immersive lighting environment can support physiological regulation as effectively as graphic biofeedback; it offers enhanced relaxation effects regarding both subjective experience and physiological arousal. These findings suggest that the biofeedback-driven ambient light can perform as persuasive technology in the domain of health self-management. The combination of decorative and informative aspects enables the lighting interface to offer the users a comfortable and relaxing condition for biofeedback-assisted relaxation training.",Citations: 22,,en

Older adults show minimal deficits when they rely on mostly preserved and relatively automatic associative retrieval processes. On the basis of this, we propose to provide external cues to support the automatic retrieval of an intended action, that is, to take medicines. To reach this end, we developed the Medication Ambient Display (MAD), a system that unobtrusively presents relevant information (unless it requires the users’ attention) and uses different abstract modalities to provide external cues that enable older adults to easily take their medications on time and be aware of their medication adherence. Objective: This study aimed to assess the adoption and effect of external cues provided through ambient displays on medication adherence in older adults. Methods: A total of 16 older adults, who took at least three medications and had mild cognitive impairment, participated in the study. We conducted a 12-week feasibility study in which we used a mixed methods approach to collect qualitative and quantitative evidence. The study included baseline, intervention, and postintervention phases. Half of the participants were randomly allocated to the treatment group (n=8), and the other half was assigned to the control group (n=8). During the study phases, research assistants measured medication adherence weekly through the pill counting technique. Results: The treatment group improved their adherence behavior from 80.9\% at baseline to 95.97\% using the MAD in the intervention phase. This decreased to 76.71\% in the postintervention phase when the MAD was no longer being used. Using a one-way repeated measures analysis of variance and a post hoc analysis using the Tukey honestly significant difference test, we identified a significant statistical difference between the preintervention and intervention phases (P=.02) and between the intervention and postintervention phases (P=.002). In addition, the medication adherence rate of the treatment group (95.97\%) was greater than that of the control group (88.18\%) during the intervention phase. Our qualitative results showed that the most useful cues were the auditory reminders, followed by the stylized representations of medication adherence. We also found that the MAD’s external cues not only improved older adults’ medication adherence but also mediated family caregivers’ involvement. Conclusions: The findings of this study demonstrate that using ambient modalities for implementing external cues is useful for drawing the attention of older adults to remind them to take medications and to provide immediate awareness on adherence behavior.",,,en
