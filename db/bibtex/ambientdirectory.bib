New insights have revealed that these brave new world scenarios are no longer desirable and that people are more in for a balanced approach in which technology should serve people instead of driving them to the max.

In this paper we discuss these novel insights and their resulting impact on the AmI research landscape. We introduce a number of new AmI research perspectives that are related to social intelligence and in addition we argue that new ways of working are required applying the concept of Experience Research resulting in a true user-centered approach to Ambient Intelligence.},

To display the four images as two stereo pairs, we must ensure each image is correctly presented to the appropriate eye. We describe a hardware solution to this display problem as well as registration and calibra- tion procedures. Theseprocedures ensure that when two users point to the same location on a virtual object, their fingers will physically touch. Since the stereo pairs are independent, we have the option of displaying specialized views of the shared virtual environment to each user.

    abstract = {One of the challenges of the ageing population in many countries is the efficient delivery of health and care services, which is further complicated by the increase in neurological conditions among the elderly due to rising life expectancy. Personal care of the elderly is of concern to their relatives, in case they are alone in their homes and unforeseen circumstances occur, affecting their wellbeing. The alternative; i.e. care in nursing homes or hospitals is costly and increases further if specialized care is mobilized to patients' place of residence. Enabling technologies for independent living by the elderly such as the ambient assisted living systems (AALS) are seen as essential to enhancing care in a cost-effective manner. In light of significant advances in telecommunication, computing and sensor miniaturization, as well as the ubiquity of mobile and connected devices embodying the concept of the Internet of Things (IoT), end-to-end solutions for ambient assisted living have become a reality. The premise of such applications is the continuous and most often real-time monitoring of the environment and occupant behavior using an event-driven intelligent system, thereby providing a facility for monitoring and assessment, and triggering assistance as and when needed. As a growing area of research, it is essential to investigate the approaches for developing AALS in literature to identify current practices and directions for future research. This paper is, therefore, aimed at a comprehensive and critical review of the frameworks and sensor systems used in various ambient assisted living systems, as well as their objectives and relationships with care and clinical systems. Findings from our work suggest that most frameworks focused on activity monitoring for assessing immediate risks, while the opportunities for integrating environmental factors for analytics and decision-making, in particular for the long-term care were often overlooked. The potential for wearable devices and sensors, as well as distributed storage and access (e.g. cloud) are yet to be fully appreciated. There is a distinct lack of strong supporting clinical evidence from the implemented technologies. Socio-cultural aspects such as divergence among groups, acceptability and usability of AALS were also overlooked. Future systems need to look into the issues of privacy and cyber security.},

We study the process of orchestration in recitation sections, i.e. when students work on their assignments individually or in small groups with the presence of teaching assistants who give help on demand. Our empirical study revealed that recitation sections suffer from inefficient orchestration. Too much attention is devoted to the management of the relationship between students and teaching assistants, which prevent both sides from concentrating on their main task. We present a model of students’ activities during recitation sections that emphasize the issue of mutual awareness, i.e. monitoring help needs and TA's availability. To tackle these difficulties, we developed two awareness tools. Both tools convey the same information: which exercise each group is working on, whether it has asked for help and for how long. In the centralized version, named Shelf, students provide information with a personal response system and the status of each team is juxtaposed on a central display. In the distributed version, named Lantern, each team provides information by interacting with a lamp placed on its table. The display is distributed over the classroom, the information being spatially associated to each group. We are now comparing these two versions in an empirical study with two first year undergraduate classes in Physics. Preliminary results show that both versions increase the efficiency of interaction between students and teaching assistants. This contribution focused on the distributed version.},

However, it may be a natural placement for vibrotactile stimulation for navigation tasks, posture and gait rehabilitation. Similarly, it may be more appropriate to render general haptic feedback to the foot when such vibrations would be distracting if delivered to other body parts. This motivated our development of a custom instrumented haptic insole, which incorporates four actuators, designed to deliver vibrotactile stimulation to the foot. As an initial test, we conducted a user study measuring recognition rates of tactons rendered during quiet stance and gait. Since actuator coupling and foot sensitivity change during gait, our insole uses a proximity sensor to detect footfall, allowing for consistent triggering at a defined point in the gait cycle when the actuators should be best coupled to the sole of the foot. We found that although overall recognition while standing ({$>$}92\%) is much better than while walking ({$>$}66\%), the majority of errors are confined to patterns that begin with the same actuator. Our initial evaluation shows promise for application of the insole, such as for sensorimotor rehabilitation and general human-computer interaction.},

Empirical qualitative data from eleven teachers in 22 class periods show that this ambient information facilitated teachers’ RiA without burdening teaching in progress.

A Smart Home is one such system but the idea extends to hospitals, public transport, factories and other environments. The achievement of Ambient Intelligence largely depends on the technology deployed (sensors and devices interconnected through networks) as well as on the intelligence of the software used for decision-making. The aims of this article are to describe the characteristics of systems with Ambient Intelligence, to provide examples of their applications and to highlight the challenges that lie ahead, especially for the Software Engineering and Knowledge Engineering communities. In particular we address system specification and verification for the former and knowledge acquisition from the vast amount of data collected for the latter.},

Two cameras on small foldable arms are positioned above the display to recognize a variety of physical objects placed on or around the tablet. These cameras have a larger field-of-view than the screen, allowing Portico to extend interaction significantly beyond the tablet itself. Our prototype, which uses a 12" tablet, delivers an interaction space six times the size of the tablet screen. Portico thus allows tablets to extend both their sensing capabilities and interaction space without sacrificing portability. We describe the design of our system and present a number of applications that demonstrate Portico’s unique capability to track objects. We focus on a number of fun applications that demonstrate how such a device can be used as a low-cost way to create personal surface computing experiences. Finally, we discuss the challenges in supporting tangible interaction beyond the screen and describe possible mechanisms for overcoming them.},

For example, we are aware of what the weather is like and we can wash our hands without actively thinking about it. Though computing technology is becoming increasingly present in our everyday routines, interactions with these technologies usually require focused attention. Inspired by our interactions in the physical world, this thesis explores the concept of peripheral interaction: interaction with technology that takes place outside the focus of attention. We believe that this direction may support interactive devices to better blend into our everyday routines. We explore peripheral interaction by observing how everyday activities take place in the periphery and by developing and deploying a number of physical peripheral interaction designs. We conclude with a set of considerations for facilitating peripheral interaction. With this work, we hope to contribute to interaction design research and practice by providing insights in how human attention abilities can be leveraged in interaction design.},

    abstract = {Primary school teachers usually perform several tasks simultaneously. Many secondary tasks, such as giving turns or encouraging children to work silently, could be supported by interactive systems, which may lighten the teacher’s busy everyday routine. Such systems however, should afford being interacted with while performing another primary task. We call this type of design peripheral interaction design. In this paper we present FireFlies, an open-ended peripheral interaction design developed for primary schools. Preliminary results of a six week deployment of FireFlies in four classrooms, reveal that teachers used FireFlies to perform secondary tasks and saw it as a valuable addition to the classroom. Though different interactions with FireFlies required different levels of effort, teachers could successfully interact with FireFlies during or in between other tasks.},

    abstract = {In everyday life, we perform several activities in our periphery of attention. For example, we are aware of what the weather is like and we can routinely wash our hands without actively thinking about it. However, we can also easily focus on these activities when desired. Contrarily, interactions with computing devices, such as smartphones and tablet computers, usually require focused attention, or even demand it through flashing displays, beeping sounds, and vibrations used to alert people. Hence, these interactions move more unpredictably between periphery and center of attention compared to non-computer-mediated activities. With the number of computers embedded in our everyday environment increasing, inevitably interaction with these computers will move to the periphery of attention. Inspired by the way we fluently divide our attentional resources over various activities in everyday life, we call this type of interaction “peripheral interaction.” We believe that considering and enabling peripheral interaction with computing technology contributes to more seamlessly embedding of such technology in everyday routines. This chapter briefly explores the history of peripheral interaction as a field of research and lays out how peripheral interaction, in our view, fits into the larger domain of interactive systems and HCI.},

    abstract = {In everyday life, we are able to perceive information and perform physical actions in the background or periphery of attention. Inspired by this observation, several researchers have studied interactive systems that display digital information in the periphery of attention. To broaden the scope of this research direction, a few recent studies have focused on interactive systems that can not only be perceived in the background but also enable users to physically interact with digital information in their periphery. Such peripheral interaction designs can support computing technology to fluently embed in and become a meaningful part of people’s everyday routines. With the increasing ubiquity of technology in our everyday environment, we believe that this direction is highly relevant nowadays. This paper presents an in-depth analysis of three case studies on peripheral interaction. These case studies involved the design and development of peripheral interactive systems and deployment of these systems in the real context of use for a number of weeks. Based on the insights gained through these case studies, we discuss generalized characteristics and considerations for peripheral interaction design and evaluation. The aim of the work presented in this paper is to support interaction design researchers and practitioners in anticipating and facilitating peripheral interaction with the designs they are evaluating or developing.},

This view is expressed in an artefact computing model and investigated in the Mediacup project, an evolving artefact computing environment. The Mediacup project provides insights into the augmentation of artefacts with sensing, processing, and communication capabilities, and into the provision of an open infrastructure for information exchange among artefacts. One of the artefacts studied is the Mediacup itself, an ordinary coffee cup invisibly augmented with computing and context-awareness. The Mediacup and other computeraugmented everyday artefacts are connected through a network infrastructure supporting loosely-coupled spatially-defined communication.},

However, social learning, inspiration and collaboration between coworkers do not come naturally. In particular in (semi-) public spaces, the behavioural norm among unacquainted coworkers is to work in individual silos without taking advantage of social learning or collaboration opportunities. This paper presents results from a pilot study of ‘Gelatine’ – a system that facilitates shared encounters between coworkers by allowing them to digitally ‘check in’ at a work space. Gelatine displays skills, areas of interest, and needs of currently present coworkers on a public screen. The results indicate that the system amplifies users’ sense of place and awareness of other coworkers, and serves as an interface for social learning through exploratory, opportunistic and serendipitous inspirations, as well as through helping users identify like-minded peers for follow-up face-toface encounters. We discuss how Gelatine is perceived by users with different pre-entry motivations, and discuss users’ challenges as well as non-use of the system.},

    abstract = {Informal interactions are a key element of workgroup communication, but have proven difficult to support in distributed groups. One reason for this is that existing systems have focused either on novel means for gathering information about the availability or activity of others, or on allowing people to display their activities to others. There has not been sufficient focus on the interplay between these activities. This interplay is important, however, because mutual awareness and attention are the mechanisms by which people negotiate the start of conversations. In this paper, we present the OpenMessenger Framework, a system and design framework rooted in the assumption that individual behaviors occur in anticipation of and/or in response to the behavior of others. We describe both the system architecture, and specific examples of the novel implementations it enables. These include techniques for coupling gathering behaviors with display behaviors, and for integrating these into user workspaces via peripheral displays and gaze tracking.},

Fortunately, extremely small projection systems are being developed that can be integrated into devices that are small enough to be body-worn, yet can project a large image onto surfaces in the environment. To explore how a user might interact with this near-horizon technology, we created a functional simulation of a wrist-worn projector. We then developed a set of interaction techniques that assume that the wrist-worn computer and projector are equipped with position and orientation sensors, in addition to a touch-sensitive builtin screen. To complement the techniques that rely on the spatial manipulation of the user’s forearm and the device itself, we also describe the use of a cursorless watch user interface that minimizes the need for the user to look down at the device’s built-in screen. Finally, we present a sample application that illustrates our interaction techniques.},

Users of such a device can explicitly turn their attention to the device if they are curious about the current weather conditions, and also be notified of a change by noticing the light changing abruptly, e.g., as a thunderstorm suddenly begins. However, especially in a mobile context, it can be difficult to have truly continuous indicators that are not fatiguing, annoying, or consuming considerable power. We propose “pseudo-ambient” displays that are not continuous, yet are nearly always accessible since they are triggered at regular intervals. Our contention is that such displays can potentially provide most of the benefits of a fully continuous ambient display, with limited drawbacks. In this work we focus on haptic pseudo-ambient displays. Yet, we believe the same approach can apply to other modalities, such as visual and audio.},

Another approach attempts not to fit complex experiences into computer models but looks at alternate uses of technology for drawing attention to the complexity of meaningmaking experiences. This second approach is introduced through the work of the Affective Presence consortium and advances the idea of design as a process of co-construction between users, systems, and designers.

Our data allow conclusions about comparative interface usability and preference, and provide an indication about metrics that are valuable to focus on in evaluations for these types of interfaces.

The main research questions were whether an attention-aware display design can capture the user’s focus of attention and whether this has an influence on the knowledge gain. A display prototype corresponding to the main ambient display characteristics was designed, applied in a controlled authentic setting, and evaluated accordingly. The prototype presented information and guidelines for first responders in emergency situations, especially in cases of cardiac arrest. The prototype was enhanced with a custom-built sensor to measure user attention and trigger interruptive notifications. The study was conducted among 52 employees working at a university campus. Using an experimental research design, a treatment group exposed to an attention-aware display design was compared to a control group. The results provide evidence that such a display design can attract and retain attention in such a way that the acquisition of knowledge (i.e. the comprehension of the presented information) is effectively facilitated.},

For the evaluation a combined approach using quantitative attention data as well as qualitative assessment methods was used.

Nevertheless, the combination of quantitative and qualitative measurement does provide a more holistic view on user attention.

In this paper, we propose applying ambient TORs, which address the peripheral vision of a driver. Conducting an experiment in a driving simulator, we tested a) ambient displays as TORs, b) whether contextual information could be conveyed through ambient TORs, and c) if the presentation pattern (static, moving) of the contextual TORs has an effect on take-over behavior. Results showed that conveying contextual information through ambient displays led to shorter reaction times and longer times to collision without increasing the workload. The presentation pattern however, did not have an effect on take-over performance.},

Although people are surrounded by flora and fauna, nature is often hidden and difficult to learn about. Birds are active outside when many people are indoors, seen but not heard, or heard but not seen. So, can technologies play a role in reconnecting us to and through nature? This project researches how to learn about local birds in a non-intrusive, fun calm and engaging manner. The Ambient Birdhouse sits inside the house and plays media of local birds - sometimes giving clues about them. Bird houses are connected. You can share bird media from your phone of your own sightings, challenging a neighbour to identify them. Known calls are interspersed with environmental sound to foster listening and developing an ear for local birds. The Ambient Birdhouse follows principles of ambient interaction. It poses the design research challenge of how to engage people in a gentle, social way over time to build awareness of nature, bringing it back into our lives.},

In this paper, we describe our design of an energy awareness artefact – the Energy AWARE Clock – and discuss it in relation to behavioural processes in the home. A user study is carried out to study the deployment of the prototype in real domestic contexts for three months. Results indicate that the Energy AWARE Clock played a significant role in drawing households’ attention to their electricity use. It became a natural part of the household and conceptions of electricity became naturalized into informants’ everyday language.},

Elderly people could clearly benefit from this concept. Thanks to smart environments, they can experience considerable enhancements, giving them an opportunity to live more independently and for longer in their home rather than in a health-care centre. However, to implement such a system, it is essential to know for whom we are designing. In this paper, we present an intelligent system with a monitoring infrastructure that will help mainly elderly users with impairments to overcome their handicap. The purpose of such a system is to create a safe and intuitive environment that will facilitate the achievement of household tasks in order to preserve independence of elderly residents for a while longer. Pursuing this goal, we propose to use the persona concept to help us build a user model based on the personas’ aptitudes. The practice of user modelling emphasizes the importance of user-centred techniques in any AmI system development and highlights the potential impacts of AmI for certain targeted groups - in this case, the elderly and people with disabilities.},

The proposal is specifically targeted to address interface design for notification systems, but its themes can be generalized to any constrained and well-defined genre of interactive system design. We reiterate arguments for and against using critical parameters to characterize user goals and usability artifacts. Responding to residual arguments, we suggest that clear advantages for research cohesion, design knowledge reuse, and HCI education are possible if several challenges are overcome. As a first step, we recommend a slight variation to the concept of a critical parameter, which would allow both abstract and concrete knowledge representation. With this concept, we demonstrate a feasible approach by introducing equations that elaborate and allow evolution of notification system critical parameters, which is made operational with a variety of usability evaluation instruments. A case study illustrates how one general instrument allowed system designs to be meaningfully compared and resulted in valuable inferences for interface reengineering. Broad implications and conclusions about this approach will be of interest to others concerned with using critical parameters in interface design, development of notification systems interfaces, or approaches to design rationale and knowledge reuse.},

However, it is not yet clear what is the best form in which to present energy information. Two six-week experiments were carried out in student residences at the University of Bath, UK, to investigate how visually displayed energy information presented in different ways could encourage reductions in energy use. Experiment 1 compared three energy display interface designs (one giving numerical information, one using analogue dials and one using emotional faces) all presenting the same information. This resulted in a 7.7\% savings over baseline. Experiment 2 examined how well participants responded to ranking information in numerical format about their own consumption. This resulted in a 2.5\% reduction from baseline. Although there was a trend towards the ambient faces display performing best, all the displays led to a reduction in energy use. A significant decrease in consumption was also seen in the groups that saw ranking information, whether compared to their baseline consumption or to the control groups. In conclusion, it would appear that the mere presence of a display device can reduce energy use, even when participants are not engaged with the display.},

Obesity is linked to several serious health problems and medical conditions. Medical experts agree that physical activity is critical to maintaining fitness, reducing weight, and improving health, yet many people have difficulty increasing and maintaining physical activity in everyday life. Clinical studies have shown that health benefits can occur from simply increasing the number of steps one takes each day and that social support can motivate people to stay active. In this paper, we describe Houston, a prototype mobile phone application for encouraging activity by sharing step count with friends. We also present four design requirements for technologies that encourage physical activity that we derived from a threeweek long in situ pilot study that was conducted with women who wanted to increase their physical activity.},

Overall, the ‘Heuristic Evaluation of Ambient Displays’ was effective –75\% of known usability problems were found by eight evaluators (39-55\% were found by 3-5 evaluators). However, the most severe usability problem found in the in situ evaluation was not identified in the heuristic evaluation.

Older adults who are not adopting SNSs might however feel like outsiders within their own families who increasingly rely on these services to socialize. Previous research has shown that situated displays can provide appropriate interfaces for older adults to use digital services. In this paper we explore how situated displays can intuitively provide ambient awareness to strengthen the family social network of older adults. We designed and developed Tlatoque, a situated display, to seamlessly integrate older adults into the SNS used by their relatives. The results of a 21-week deployment study of an initial version of Tlatoque in one extended family showed that the older adult became more conscious of relatives’ activities, which also enriched in-person encounters. However, relatives expected the older adult to reply to their posts in the SNS and Tlatoque lacked mechanisms for the older adult to provide feedback. We re-designed Tlatoque to incorporate means for enabling the older adult to share information back to the SNS. We conducted a second 21-week deployment study with another extended family to evaluate the use of this new version of the system. Our results indicate that the second design was successful in providing ambient awareness to the older adult as well as to her relatives. We conclude that situated displays that provide SNS services can assist the integration of older adults to their social network and contribute to enhance asymmetric relations between the older adult and younger relatives.},

As proof of concept, we implemented a drawing application that uses vessels to control a virtual brush whose stroke width corresponds to the filling level. Furthermore, we found that humans can distinguish nine levels of haptic feedback when sliding water-filled paper cups (300 ml capacity) over a wooden surface. This discrimination follows Weber's Law and was facilitated by sloshing of water.},

Audible notification cues are often a cause of unnecessary disruption and distraction both for co-located people and even for the user to whom they are directed. We present a wearable peripheral display embedded in eyeglasses that delivers subtle, discreet and unobtrusive cues. The display is personal and intimate; it delivers visual cues in the wearers’ periphery without disrupting their immediate environment. A user study conducted to validate the design reveals that the display is effective and subtle in notifying users. Experimental results show, with significance, that the cues can be designed to meet specific levels of visibility and disruption for the wearer, so that some cues are less noticeable when the user is not under high workload, which is highly desirable in many practical circumstances. Hence, peripheral notification displays can provide an effective solution for designing socially acceptable notification displays, unobtrusive to the user and the immediate environment.},

The encoded images are visible only to cameras synchronized with the projectors and exposed for a short interval, while the original images appear only minimally degraded to the human eye. To achieve this goal, we analyze and exploit the micro-mirror modulation pattern used by the projection technology to generate intensity levels for each pixel and color channel. Our real-time embedding process maps the user's original color image values to the nearest values whose camera-perceived intensities are the ones desired by the binary image to be embedded. The color differences caused by this mapping process are compensated by error-diffusion dithering. The non-intrusive nature of our approach allows simultaneous (immersive) display and acquisition under controlled lighting conditions, as defined on a pixel level by the binary patterns. We therefore introduce structured light techniques into human-inhabited mixed and augmented reality environments, where they previously often were too intrusive.},

    abstract = {Do inexperienced drivers see less of the world when driving? Previous research suggests that participants detect fewer peripheral targets while watching video clips of dynamic hazardous driving scenes due to increases in foveal demand (i.e. the presence of a hazard), increases in peripheral target eccentricity, and the lack of driving experience. The current study aimed to further explore the role of experience as a key factor in the potential narrowing of spatial attention, and the possibility of differences in the time course of attentional deployment. It was predicted that the amount of narrowing due to central processing demands would change as a function of driving experience, with more experienced drivers suffering less narrowing due to their mastery of central processing demands in road scenes. The data did not support the narrowing hypothesis, though they did support the alternative strategic difference between the driver groups in the time-course of attentional deployment. Learners seem to suffer attentional degradation in extra-foveal regions over a longer period of time whereas experienced drivers seem to invest peripheral attention at the hazard location in short but intense bursts.

In this paper we present Logue, a system that provides realtime feedback on the presenters’ openness, body energy and speech rate during public speaking. The system analyses the user’s nonverbal behaviour using social signal processing techniques and gives visual feedback on a head-mounted display. We conducted two user studies with a staged and a real presentation scenario which yielded that Logue’s feedback was perceived helpful and had a positive impact on the speaker’s performance.},

Additionally, we describe the design, development, and assessment of a bidirectional ambient display platform to support realtime activity awareness and social connectedness in mediated AAL contexts. In a semi-controlled study, we evaluate a conglomerate of activitybased lighting displays, to determine the effects of real-time bidirectional deployment on behaviour and social connectedness. Exploiting everyday objects, human activity levels are projected with a Philips Hue lamp, LED wallet, and LED walking cane, which render this information based on predefined patterns of light. Results from the current study show tendencies toward (1) an increase in implicit social interactions (e.g., the sense of experienced social presence and connectedness), (2) more positive social behaviours between the elderly and their caregivers in mediated AAL contexts, and (3) sporadic moments of interpersonal activity synchrony however, further investigation is necessary to determine the extent of this variable in mediated AAL contexts.},

AAL systems provide health monitoring through sensor based technologies to preserve health and functional ability and facilitate social support for the ageing population. Human activity recognition (HAR) is an enabler for the development of robust AAL solutions, especially in safety critical environments. Therefore, HAR models applied within this domain (e.g. for fall detection or for providing contextual information to caregivers) need to be accurate to assist in developing reliable support systems. In this paper, we evaluate three machine learning algorithms, namely Support Vector Machine (SVM), a hybrid of Hidden Markov Models (HMM) and SVM (SVM-HMM) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) applied on a dataset collected between the elderly and their caregiver counterparts. Detected activities will later serve as inputs to a bidirectional activity awareness system for increasing social connectedness. Results show high classification performances for all three algorithms. Specifically, the SVMHMM hybrid demonstrates the best classification performance. In addition to this, we make our dataset publicly available for use by the machine learning community.},

    abstract = {Computing devices and applications are now used beyond the desktop, in diverse environments, and this trend toward ubiquitous computing is accelerating. One challenge that remains in this emerging research field is the ability to enhance the behavior of any application by informing it of the context of its use. By context, we refer to any information that characterizes a situation related to the interaction between humans, applications, and the surrounding environment. Context-aware applications promise richer and easier interaction, but the current state of research in this field is still far removed from that vision. This is due to 3 main problems: (a) the notion of context is still ill defined, (b) there is a lack of conceptual models and methods to help drive the design of context-aware applications, and (c) no tools are available to jump-start the development of context-aware applications. In this anchor article, we address these 3 problems in turn. We first define context, identify categories of contextual information, and characterize context-aware application behavior. Though the full impact of context-aware computing requires understanding very subtle and high-level notions of context, we are focusing our efforts on the pieces of context that can be inferred automatically from sensors in a physical environment. We then present a conceptual framework that separates the acquisition and representation of context from the delivery and reaction to context by a context-aware application. We have built a toolkit, the Context Toolkit, that instantiates this conceptual framework and supports the rapid development of a rich space of context-aware applications. We illustrate the usefulness of the conceptual framework by describing a number of context-aware applications that have been prototyped using the Context Toolkit. We also demonstrate how such a framework can support the investigation of important research challenges in the area of context-aware computing.},

    abstract = {Beyond phones, watches, and activity tracking devices, a new ecosystem of functional and fashionable wearable technologies can easily, safely, and economically be designed, prototyped, and integrated directly on the body. In this paper, we present AlterNail, a fingernail form factor, ambient, lowpower, stateful, wireless, dynamic display with onboard vibrational sensing. AlterNail integrates a batteryless design using inductive coupling with e-ink technology to enable both quick dynamic and long-term static fingernail based visual designs without the need for power. We also detail the use of simple vibrational signals to uniquely identify everyday objects as they are handled using AlterNails. The intentionally limited interactional functionality of AlterNails, coupled with the rich personal and dynamic expressive potential, combine to present a compelling range of opportunities for designers of new interactive wearable technologies. We detail a range of practical and playful applications using this technology.},

In a user study with 15 students preparing for a university exam across 3 weeks we compared the effects of an active learning platform with passive learning through peripheral displays.

We propose a dynamic Bayesian network model to infer the focus of attention, which models the relation between multiple foci of attention, multiple user locations and faces captured by the multiple cameras in the environment. Head pose is not explicitly computed but measured by a similarity vector which represents the likelihoods of multiple face clusters. Video data are collected in the Ambient Kitchen environment and experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our model.},

While task accuracy was the same for all interfaces, mouse input performed the fastest and input with a tracked paddle the slowest. Performance with the physical sliders fell between those two. We present these results along with various findings from user comments, and discuss how they may influence the design of future desktop AR systems.},

However, unlike other recent interactive technologies such as smartphones, they have not yet found their way into people’s everyday lives. Possible reasons include high cost as well as a lack of suitable applications. In this paper, we present our prototypical implementation of a low-cost, unobtrusive interactive surface, integrated with the dining table in a real-world living room. To motivate our approach, we explore three scenarios highlighting potential applications for our system and present their prototypical implementations. In the first scenario, we extend regular board games with interactive components without sacrificing their unique haptic experience. In the second scenario, we investigate ambient notifications which provide a method for delivering information to the users subconsciously. Finally, we explore the concept of augmented dining in which the appearance of food placed on the table is augmented or modified by the system.},

In this paper we offer an alternative perspective on the use of tangibility in interaction, in which meaning is created not through precise manipulations of a computationally-interpreted spatial syntax, but through imprecise interactions with independently meaningful, digitally-augmented physical tokens. Users are free to arrange such tokens around the periphery of their workspace, away from their normal centre of attention, ready to selectively and fluidly engage them in loosely related, dispersed episodes of use. We call this concept “peripheral tangible interaction”, and in this paper we describe both our analytic approach to designing a personal desktop TUI supporting such an interaction style, and user responses to its analytically-inspired features during extended deployment in a real office context.},

However the associated user-interfaces and displays can be hard to understand, potentially preventing households from optimizing their solar usage. This paper introduces a known method being deployed in a new context. It reports on on-going research that investigates the effect of in-home ambient light displays linked to the home battery system. The paper covers the design stage and potential feedback solutions to raise awareness and influence consumer behaviour to promote energy conservation. An Ambient Light System is proposed to enable better user feedback. The study outlines the design recommendation for an ambient light display to be used in an energy consumption context. Using such a display, households can optimize use of low Carbon solar energy within the home, thus minimizing grid electricity usage.},

Yet we also know that digital information is becoming increasingly important to households. The problem is that this digital information is almost always tied to traditional computer displays, which inhibits its incorporation into household routines. Our solution, location-dependent information appliances, exploit both home location and context (as articulated in ethnographic studies) to enhance the role of ambient displays in the home setting; these displays provide home occupants with both background awareness of an information source and foreground methods to gain further details if desired. The novel aspect is that home occupants assign particular information to locations within a home in a way that makes sense to them. As a device is moved to a particular home location, information is automatically mapped to that device along with hints on how it should be displayed.},

The first enables Wattom to power a connected device, and provide real-time feedback on the amount of electricity in the grid from renewable sources. The second enables users to schedule power events from their smart watches. Finally, the third application uses non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM) to provide users with personal consumption information on multiple devices connected to a single Wattom plug.

While the tracked data can help inform people of their health, many find that it adds unnecessary anxieties in the way the feedback is provided. In the case of college students, they spend most of their time in a stressful environment, leading them to an increase in the risk of mental health issues. To help with this issue, we present Heart Waves, an experimental ambient feedback system that tracks heart rate and uses water sound to provide feedback in a stressful work environment. Heart Waves uses the sound of falling water to create a relaxing atmosphere to help ease any stress they are going through. As the user’s heart rate goes up, the flow of water increases, and as their heart rate goes down, the flow rate of water decreases. The purpose of this project is to automatize the processing of heart rate data so that the user does not have to analyze the data and create an ambient feedback system that adjusts to their heart rate.},

It is hoped that the ambient audio presentation of Twitter feeds will help spark informal conversations among individuals in an organisation, while also helping individuals keep up to date with events within the organisation. We have designed TOL to be placed in a staff common room, where staff already habituate, to enhance an existing practice (having meals) to foster engagement among staff.

Nevertheless, mobile devices act as an imperfect virtual window, thus research is also exploring how to make AR systems wearable. In this direction, this paper describes a wearable system that uses projected interfaces and gesture-based interaction to enable an AR experience within a smart environment. It is composed of a Pico projector, a Raspberry Pi equipped both with WiFi and ZigBee interfaces and a handheld gesture detection device. Scattered in the environment, different Arduino objects with sensors and ZigBee connectivity capabilities propose projected services to nearby users. The system's architecture is detailed and exemplified with three types of objects: a navigation beacon, a smart plant pot and a game box.},

    abstract = {Informative Art display systems have been proposed to provide users with information considered relevant at arbitrary points of work or living engagement, originating from many different –mostly geographically dislocated–sources and presented at the periphery of human (visual) perception. Having the displays operate at the periphery of a user's attention allows other user tasks to sustain primary. Much like the information presented by wallclocks, posters, paintings or windows, peripheral displays move to the center of attention only when appropriate and desirable. Abstract art has been proposed to serve as the visualization paradigm, encoding information into graphical or pictorial artwork by subtly modifying its shape, color and appearance details or its overall impression. This paper approaches a systematic elaboration of visual metaphors able to deliver information via peripheral displays in an aesthetic, artful way. In our approach, the choice of metaphors is driven by the aesthetic appeal of the visual appearance of the display as a whole, out of which certain dynamic emblems or symbols are used to conotate information in a visual style. From experiments we find, that such metaphors are considered by users as a means of personal emotional expression, and that controllable aesthetic attractiveness turns out to be the dominant factor of display appreciation. The choice of aesthetic themes, as well as the control of emblem and symbol dynamics are supported and implemented in our peripheral display framework, a general purpose software framework for informative art display systems.},

    abstract = {A recent study revealed that every fourth German adult drinks less than 1.5 litres a day. Insufficient fluid intake can cause headache, lack of energy and lightheadedness. Signals can be used to be reminded of drinking. However, these are often missed or even deactivated because they are too obvious. On the basis of a participatory design study, we designed the fashionable light bracelet WaterJewel as an awareness display and an unobtrusive reminder for a regular fluid intake. In a four-week 12-participant study, we explored the use of WaterJewel in daily life and how it compared to a prevalent mobile drinking reminder application. Our results show that with WaterJewel participants drank more in total, more often accomplished the daily drinking goal of 2 litres, drank more regularly, and drank more often prior to the reminder event than with the mobile application. Participants rated WaterJewel as very usable and appreciated its practical and discreet design.},

    abstract = {In many cities around the world, surveillance by a pervasive net of CCTV cameras is a common phenomenon in an attempt to uphold safety and security across the urban environment. Video footage is being recorded and stored, sometimes live feeds are being watched in control rooms hidden from public access and view. In this study, we were inspired by Steve Mann’s original work on sousveillance (surveillance from below) to examine how a network of camera equipped urban screens could allow the residents of Oulu in Finland to collaborate on the safekeeping of their city. An agile, rapid prototyping process led to the design, implementation and ‘in the wild’ deployment of the UbiOpticon screen application. Live video streams captured by web cams integrated at the top of 12 distributed urban screens were broadcast and displayed in a matrix arrangement on all screens. The matrix also included live video streams of two roaming mobile phone cameras. In our field study we explored the reactions of passers-by and users of this screen application that seeks to inverse Bentham’s original panopticon by allowing the watched to be watchers at the same time. In addition to the original goal of participatory sousveillance, the system’s live video feature sparked fun and novel user-led apprlopriations.},

    abstract = {With recent advancements in supporting fields like Embedded Systems and Ambient Assisted Living (AAL), intelligent environments are becoming reality. Learning and adapting to user behaviors and gaining some basic knowledge about the underlying user intentions and activities are essential features of an intelligent system. Many systems use an underlying environment model with spatial and semantic information, and often the manual creation of such spatial semantic models is an error-prone and time-consuming task. Moreover, these approaches often neglect how people actually use their physical space. The concept of Activity Zones defines the environmental context by regions of similar user activities and can be learned by observing human behavior. In this paper, we present our approach to extend the notion of Activity Zones by applying a three-dimensional zone computation and visualization process that is independent from the present smart home infrastructure and that is able to autonomously adapt to changes in the environment as well as to shifts in the user behavior.},

The analysis draws on our review of more than 70 AmI projects, principally in Europe. It notes the visions as well as the specifics of typical AmI scenarios. Several conclusions can be drawn from the analysis, not least of which is that most AmI scenarios depict a rather too sunny view of our technological future. Finally, reference is made to the SWAMI project (Safeguards in a World of Ambient Intelligence) which, inter alia, has constructed ”dark” scenarios, as we term them, to show how things can go wrong in AmI and where safeguards are needed.},

We then describe the results of a 3-week field study (N=13) of the UbiGreen Transportation Display prototype, a mobile phone application that semi-automatically senses and reveals information about transportation behavior. Our contributions include a working system for semiautomatically tracking transit activity, a visual design capable of engaging users in the goal of increasing green transportation, and the results of our studies, which have implications for the design of future green applications.},

Then we conducted a user study to confirm the efficiency of our system’s vibrationizing and users’ impressions of U-brella.

    abstract = {We propose a room-shaped information environment called Ambient Suite that enhances communication among multiple participants. In Ambient Suite, the room itself works as both sensors to estimate the conversation states of participants and displays to present information to stimulate conversation. Such nonverbal cues as utterances, positions, and gestures are measured to sense participant states. The participants are surrounded by displays so that various types of information can be given based on their states. Although this system is adaptable to a wide range of situations where groups talk with each other, our implementation assumed standing-party situations as a typical case. Using this implementation, we experimentally evaluated the performance of input, output, and whether our system can actually stimulate conversation. The results showed that our system measured sensor data to recognize the conversational states, presented information, and adequately encouraged participant conversations.},

Main problem with creating ambient user interface is that for different domains the human-computer interaction changes. In this article we investigate different tools that are employed in ambient user interface and the different approaches how they are used. We focus mainly on the use of the multi-display set-up, touch screens, kinect, eye-tracking devices and brain-computer interface technology. We propose approaches how they can be utilized in an ambient user interface, how they affect the user and how they can be used for the evaluation of ambient user interface. It is essential for future research that these measures evaluate the efficiency of the use of ambient user interface in different domains. We briefly analyze natural user interface and its association to ambient user interface. In the conclusion we establish the steps for the future research of this topic.},

The Tablecloth explores an approach to design that emphasises engaging, open-ended situations over defined utilitarian purposes. Long-term deployment of the History Tablecloth in a volunteer household revealed complex ways that people experienced and interacted with the Tablecloth. Beyond evoking reflection on the flow of objects over a particular table, the Tablecloth served as a ground for interpretative reflection about technology, an asset for social interaction, and an aesthetic object. Even behaviours we saw as system errors were interpreted by the users as interactively rich. Their experience highlights the subtlety of domestic ubiquitous computing, illustrating alternatives to traditional views of technology’s domestic role.},

    abstract = {In-situ exploration of heart rate (HR) zones during cardio training (CT) is important for training efficiency. However, approaches for monitoring HR, either depend on complex visualizations on small screens (i.e., smartwatches) or intrusive modalities (i.e. haptic, auditory) that might force the attention to the information. We developed an early prototype, Howel, a novel wrist-worn soft wearable to display HR zone information during CT. Our concept utilizes mapping information onto dynamic patterns (color changing stripes) as an easy-to-understand ambient display. To preserve non-intrusiveness, it uses non-emissive modality by heating thermochromic paints on its textile surfaces. Early feedback from three participants suggests that soft wearables with non- emissive dynamic patterns have potential (1) to embed information organically on the body, (2) to give easy-to-understand in-situ intensity information and (3) to keep the attention on the exercise instead of performance measures.},

In this work, we explore the possibility of constructing a controllable dynamic plant-based display using thigmonastic plants, i.e. plants that change the shape and position of their leaves as a response to external stimuli. As an initial step towards this vision, we first introduce our approach of building a plant-based pixel (plant-pixel, or plantxel), and the principles of composing a plantxel-based public display. We then present the results of a feasibility study conducted with Mimosa spegazzinii plants, showing that our approach can achieve an acceptable contrast ratio, which in turn depends on leaves density. Based on the results of the study, we present a working prototype of a plantxel that is composed of a plant, the air-based stimulation system, and the control logic. The prototype allowed us to assess the effectiveness of our design choices, and to outline some potential limitations. Finally, we discuss the possibilities of using such plant-based display for dynamic information visualization in public spaces and provide directions for future work.},

They also post items they believe will be interesting to others, such as vacation photos.

Digital photo frames are a popular class of private situated displays particularly aimed at this purpose. However, their evaluation can be challenging as a significant amount of interaction takes place by looking at the device, i.e., without direct user input. In addition, a photo display can effect people’s perception, without it being at the centre of focussed attention. For tracking use without explicit input and getting a sense of the users’ peripheral perception - and hence the users’ potential awareness of situated displays - we therefore propose a lightweight, unobtrusive and affordable method named Trackaware, drawing on advances in camera hardware and software. We are particularly interested in how researchers and study participants engage with this method and what insights they can obtain. We studied Trackaware involving 61 participants, and our findings suggest that Trackaware can be a strong method for complementing existing evaluation techniques, e.g., in a data triangulation strategy. It should be useful for investigating digital photo frames and other visual peripheral displays, particularly in personal contexts.},

While they cannot see the results of their interaction, they do obtain some visual feedback by watching their hands move. Our user studies show that Imaginary Interfaces allow users to create simple drawings, to annotate with them and to operate interfaces, as long as their layout mimics a physical device they have used before. We demonstrate how this allows an imaginary interface to serve as a shortcut for a physical device and we believe that ultimately Imaginary Interfaces will lead to the development of standalone ultra-mobile devices.},

This is done by dynamic glowing patterns produced by electroluminescent wires molded into the transparent electrical cord. Using this fully functional prototype, we have been investigating how such ambient displays can be used to increase energy awareness. An initial user study indicates that the Power-Aware Cord is a very accessible and intuitive mean for better understanding energy consumption.

    abstract = {Fuji-chan is a simple ambient display device, which uses a wireless internet connection to monitor two important characteristics of Mount Fuji, Japan’s largest mountain. This system utilises two internet-based data feeds to inform people of the weather conditions at the peak of the mountain, along with the current level of volcanic eruption risk. We consider the latter information in particular to be of great importance. These two data feeds are communicated via LEDs placed at the top and base of the device, along with aural output to indicate volcanic eruption warning levels. We also created a simple web interface for this information. By creating this device and application, we aim to reimagine how geospatial information can be presented, while also creating something which is visually appealing. Through the demonstration of this multimodal system, we also aim to promote the idea of an “Internet of Beautiful Things”, where IOT technology is applied to interactive artworks.},

    abstract = {The visualisation of historical information and storytelling in museums is a crucial process for transferring knowledge by directly and simplistically engaging the museum audience. Until recently, technological limitations meant museums were limited to 2D and 3D screen-based information displays. However, advancements in Mixed reality (MR) devices permit the propagation of a virtual overlay that amalgamates both real-world and virtual environments into a single spectrum. These holographical devices project a 3D space around the user which can be augmented with virtual artefacts, thus potentially changing the traditional museum visitor experience. Few research studies focus on utilising this virtual space to generate objects that do not visually inhibit or distract the operator. Therefore, this paper aims to introduce the Ambient Information Visualisation Concept (AIVC) as a new form of storytelling, which can enhance the communication and interactivity between museum visitors and exhibits by measuring and sustaining an optimum spatial environment around the user.},

Our own work is targeted towards the development of an AAL system -called CARE- that provides assistance in form of recommendations helping its users overcome typical difficulties of everyday life, and contributes positively to their well-being. To inform the design of the envisioned CARE system we recruited two peer groups of potential users, a group of 20 Greek seniors, and a group of 27 German seniors, and conducted structured interviews which were focused on the seniors’ life-style, medical needs, attitude towards AAL technologies, and, more specifically, on desired functions and system configurations of a recommendationgiving CARE system. We discuss outcomes of the conducted interviews and sketch a first CARE prototype which appears as an augmented digital picture frame that interleaves the display of photos with recommendations and interventions to improve the seniors’ life-style and well-being.},

In a study with 30 participants, we evaluated two prototype auditory displays against the baseline of visual-only eco-driving feedback in a within-subject study. Our selected designs are described in full detail. Key findings include a significantly reduced fuel consumption as well as lower engine speeds compared to the visual display. Furthermore, questionnaire analysis results confirm that the auditory conditions are less obtrusive and also seem to allow a more subconscious processing and comprehension of the provided information. Finally, we have found that the affectiveness of the display design seems to have a positive impact on its perceived helpfulness and the ability to absorb its information subconsciously.},

Using the interaction sound of waterdrops falling onto the bathtub as a carrier for information, our system supports users to be in touch with resource-related variables. We explore the usage of an affective dimension as an additional layer of information and introduce our 4/5-factor approach to adapt the auditory display’s output so that it supports a slow but steady adjustment of the personal showering habit over time.

    abstract = {Peripheral interaction, like ambient information systems (AIS), aims at leveraging the periphery of our attention. While ambient information systems address the perception of information, peripheral interaction targets lightweight interaction outside of the current focus of attention. A number of prototypes have demonstrated the value of peripheral interaction through long-term in-situ deployments. Such studies are particularly suited to evaluate peripheral interaction since they enable the integration of devices into daily routines and thereby move interaction to the periphery of attention. However, they do not lend themselves well to early design phases. In fact, the design process completely lacks early evaluation tools to assess design choices.},

We drink a cup of tea while reading a book, we signal a colleague passing by with a hand gesture, that we are concentrated right now and that he should wait one moment, or we walk a few steps backwards while taking photos. Many of these interactions – like drinking, sending signals via gestures or walking – are rather complex by themselves. By means of learning and training, however, these interactions become part of our routines and habits and therefore only consume little or no attentional resources. In contrast, when interacting with digital devices, we are often asked for our full attention. To carry out – even small and marginal tasks – we are regularly forced to switch windows, do precise interactions (e.g., pointing with the mouse) and thereby these systems trigger context and focus switches, disrupting us in our main focus and task. Peripheral interaction aims at making use of human capabilities and senses like divided attention, spatial memory and proprioception to support interaction with digital devices in the periphery of the attention, consequently quasi-parallel to another primary task.},

They are commonly used at a distance, i.e., across countries and continents. To avoid disrupting other tasks, they display personal states to signal others when to contact someone and when not. This mechanism, however, heavily relies on users setting their own state correctly. In an online survey with 46 participants we found that neglecting state updates leads to unwanted messages, either because the state is incorrect or others disrespect it because they assume it to be wrong anyway. We address this situation with the StaTube, a tangible object offering (1) peripheral interaction for setting one’s own state and (2) peripheral awareness of selected others’ state. In an in-situ evaluation we found first indicators that (1) peripheral interaction fosters more frequent state updates and more accurate state information, and (2) that our participants felt more aware of their contacts’ states due to the physical ambient representation.},

A household with a family of five was used as test environment. The design process underwent two major design iterations focusing on the visualization and its impact on the family’s everyday perception of the indoor temperature, and the reflective processes this triggered. After three months of usage, late December to late March, the system was evaluated thoroughly.

    abstract = {Most current interface designs require that the user focus their attention on them in order to be of value. However, as the price of computation falls, and computational capabilities make their way into many everyday objects, the demand for attention from many different directions may begin to seriously reduce the usefulness of these computational objects. Ambient information displays are intended to fit in a part of the interface design space that does not have this property. They are designed to convey background or context information that the user may or may not wish to attend to at any given time. Ambient Displays are designed to work primarily in the periphery of a user's awareness, moving to the center of attention only when appropriate and desirable. This paper describes a new ambient information display that is designed to give a rich medium of expression placed within an aesthetically pleasing decorative object. This display \&mdash; the Information Percolator \&mdash; is formed by air bubbles rising up tubes of water. By properly controlling the release of air, a set of pixels which scroll up the display is created. This allows a rendition of any (small, black and white) image to be displayed. The detailed design and construction of this display device will be considered, along with several applications.},

The main challenges for finding such balance lie in the acquisition of availability information from the interruptee and its delivery to the interrupter. In this demonstration, we show how common technical approaches in ubicomp can address some of the problems typically encountered in availability sharing. We present InterruptMe, a novel availability sharing system that uses sensor information to calculate multiple availability measures for each interruptee and that delivers this information in the periphery of the interrupter’s attention by using a projected peripheral display and monitoring implicit inputs to the system.},

However, the invisible nature of such an infrastructure hinders adoption, as it is difficult for users to participate in an infrastructure they are not aware of. This paper introduces GridOrbit, a system designed to increase user awareness, fostering contributions to this infrastructure. We designed GridOrbit using a participatory design process with biologists, and subsequently deployed it for use in a biology laboratory. Our results indicate that the number of contributors to the MiniGrid increased with the use of awareness technologies. In addition, our analysis presents their motives and behaviors. Finally, a characterization of user interaction with GridOrbit emerged, which enabled us to understand how awareness systems can be better designed. We see GridOrbit as an example of a broader class of technologies designed to create ‘Infrastructure Awareness’ as a means to increase the contributions to technological infrastructures.},

    abstract = {We developed two visual displays for providing awareness of environmental audio to deaf individuals. Based on fieldwork with deaf and hearing participants, we focused on supporting awareness of non-speech audio sounds such as ringing phones and knocking in a work environment. Unlike past work, our designs support both monitoring and notification of sounds, support discovery of new sounds, and do not require a priori knowledge of sounds to be detected. Our Spectrograph design shows pitch and amplitude, while our Positional Ripples design shows amplitude and location of sounds. A controlled experiment involving deaf participants found neither display to be significantly distracting. However, users preferred the Positional Ripples display and found that display easier to monitor (notification sounds were detected with 90\% success in a laboratory setting). The Spectrograph display also supported successful detection in most cases, and was well received when deployed in the field.},

The advent of new markets, such as the smart home sector, and movements, such as the quantified self, indicate the IoT’s huge economic and social impact. With the increased availability of IoT services, it becomes important to enable users with intuitive mechanisms for accessing the gathered data. In this work, we present findings from an exploratory design case study, in which we deployed a low-res lighting display in three family households to visualize domestic energy performance data. Our study showed that the standalone lighting display was preferred over a commercially available web-based application. Further, we found that in two of the three households those participants, who did not use the mobile application before, became the main user of the display and actively engaged with the visualized data. The paper concludes with design implications for pervasive displays connected as ambient gateways to smart devices.},

SketchSpace requires no augmentation of the device itself, but instead it uses a depth-sensing Kinect camera to simulate the use of hardware sensors by using depth information to infer an object's three-dimensional position, motion, proximity, shape, deformations, and touch events on its surface. A designer can map these inputs to desktop applications in real-time and thus experiment with different interactions. We showcase how SketchSpace can be used to prototype two devices: from tilt sensitive mice to bendable displays. In general, we discuss how this simplifies the process of generating an interactive device sketch and supports rapid exploration of design solutions.},

We propose context proximity for selective artefact communication, using the context of artefacts for matchmaking. We further suggest to empower users with simple but effective means to impose the same context on a number of artefacts. To prove our point we have implemented Smart-Its Friends, small embedded devices that become connected when a user holds them together and shakes them.},

In this paper, we document our design process and report the results of a 2-week field study. We put our living plant display, and its robotic counterpart, in a cafeteria between pairs of trash and recycling containers. Contributions of recyclables or trash triggered directional bursts of light that gradually induced the plant displays to lean toward the more active container. In interviews, people offered explanations for the displays and spoke of caring for the plants. A marginally significant increase in recycling behavior (p=.08) occurred at the display with living plants. Apparent increases also occurred at the robotic display and a unit with only lights. Our findings indicate value in exploring the use of living material and biomimetic forms in displays, and in using lightweight robotics to deliver simple rewards.},

It was advertised as an ambient display, using strong product images suggesting that it is a pet alternative. However, after early interest, the popularity of this product did not last long. In this paper, we demonstrate interaction criticism as an approach to design research, exploring and proposing reasons for the product’s decline. Specifically, we argue that the rabbit is difficult to connect with emotionally and explore several reasons this might be true. Our approach is phenomenological and hermeneutic in nature: we engaged in product usage for over twelve months, and practice a theoretically informed interpretive analysis. Using a combination of critical theories and affect research from robotics, we argue the Nabaztag product identity is confusing, which might be related to the manufactures’ multiple intentions, and the gap between ideal and real users. We continue with an account of two genres of functions in the Nabaztag, revealing how they polarize of interpretation; moments when Nabaztag acted in unexpected ways; and the increased, rather than decreased, difficulty in interpreting Nabaztag the longer we used it. Interpretively understanding Nabaztag’s experiential failures helps cultivate relevant design sensitivities and even implications for future designs.},

    abstract = {The globalization of the workforce, growing prevalence of dynamic project-oriented teams, increasing flexibility in work times and places is beneficial to companies and workers. However, they contribute to the fragmentation of the workforce, reducing awareness of colleagues’ activities. These awareness “gaps” result in missed opportunities for collaboration and sharing of relevant knowledge, as well as a diminished sense of community. We have conducted a user study to better understand these gaps in one particular workgroup, and designed a system to promote stronger awareness of workplace activities using peripheral displays.},

    abstract = {The majority of systems using public displays to foster awareness have focused on providing information across remote locations or among people who are loosely connected and lack awareness of each other’s activities or interests. We have, however, identified many potential benefits for an awareness system that displays information within a small, co-located group in which the members already possess some awareness of each other’s activities. By using “SemiPublic Displays,” public displays scoped for small groups, we can make certain types of information visible in the environment, promoting collaboration and providing lightweight information about group activity. Compared to designing for large, loosely connected groups, designing for Semi-Public Displays mitigates typically problematic issues in sustaining relevant content for the display and minimizing privacy concerns. We are using these applications to support and enhance the interactions and information that group members utilize to maintain awareness and collaborate.},

    abstract = {Energy-efficiency related research has reached a growing interest in recent years due to the imminent scarcity of non-renewable resources in our environment and the impending impacts their usage have on our environment. Thus, facing the reduction of energy waste and management has become a pivotal issue in our society. To cope with energy inefficiency, the scientific research community has identified the promotion of people’s behaviour change as a critical field to foster environmental sustainability. However, the body of literature shows a lack of systematic methods and processes to reach a common ground when designing technology for promoting sustainable behaviour change. Therefore, this paper contributes with a thorough review and analysis of state of the art. Firstly, theoretical works related to behaviour change are collected and studied to clarify their main concepts and theories. Secondly, the different technologies, processes, methods and techniques applied in the field are reviewed to find diverse strategies in the application of the previously explained theoretical domains. Moreover, a wide range of systems developed to improve energy efficiency through human behaviour change is analysed (from augmented objects to the Internet of Things, digital applications or websites). Finally, the detected research gaps are listed to guide future research when aiming to raise the awareness of individuals through Information and Communication Technologies.},

    abstract = {This paper first discusses the misinterpretation of the concept of “ubiquitous computing” that Mark Weiser originally proposed in 1991. Weiser’s main message was not the ubiquity of computers, but the transparency of interface that determines users’ perception of digital technologies embedded in our physical environment seamlessly. To explore Weiser’s philosophy of transparency in interfaces, this paper presents the design of an interface that uses glass bottles as “containers” and “controls” for digital information. The metaphor is a perfume bottle: Instead of scent, the bottles have been filled with music — classical, jazz, and techno music. Opening each bottle releases the sound of a specific instrument accompanied by dynamic colored light. Physical manipulation of the bottles —opening and closing — is the primary mode of interaction for controlling their musical contents. The bottles illustrates Mark Weiser’s vision of the transparent (or invisible) interface that weaves itself into the fabric of everyday life. The bottles also exploits the emotional aspects of glass bottles that are tangible and visual, and evoke the smell of perfume and the taste of exotic beverages. This paper describes the design goals of the bottle interface, the arrangement of musical content, the implementation of the wireless electromagnetic tag technology, and the feedback from users who have played with the system.},

Its design is inspired by animation arts and theater, which rely heavily on body language to express emotions. Its shape and movement reflect the form of the human body; an upright position reflecting the body's refreshed pose, and a slouching position reflecting the body's pose after sitting for a long time. An initial evaluation shows a correlation between the movement of the sculpture and when participants took breaks, suggesting that ambient displays that make use of aesthetic and lifelike form might be promising for making positive changes in human behavior.},

These displays were used in a reading study with parents reading for their children and a focus group session.

    abstract = {We introduce Blended Interaction, a new conceptual framework that helps to explain when users perceive user interfaces as “natural” or not. Based on recent findings from embodied cognition and cognitive linguistics, Blended Interaction provides a novel and more accurate description of the nature of human–computer interaction (\{HCI).\} In particular, it introduces the notion of conceptual blends to explain how users rely on familiar and real-world concepts whenever they learn to use new digital technologies. We apply Blended Interaction in the context of post-\{“Windows\} Icons Menu Pointer” interactive spaces. These spaces are ubiquitous computing environments for computer-supported collaboration of multiple users in a physical space or room, e.g., meeting rooms, design studios, or libraries, augmented with novel interactive technologies and digital computation, e.g., multi-touch walls, tabletops, and tablets. Ideally, in these spaces, the virtues of the familiar physical and social world are combined with that of the digital realm in a considered manner so that desired properties of each are preserved and a seemingly “natural” \{HCI\} is achieved. To support designers in this goal, we explain how the users' conceptual systems use blends to tie together familiar concepts with the novel powers of digital computation. Furthermore, we introduce four domains of design to structure the underlying problem and design space: individual and social interaction, workflow, and physical environment. We introduce our framework by discussing related work, e.g., metaphors, mental models, direct manipulation, image schemas, reality-based interaction, and illustrate Blended Interaction using design decisions we made in recent projects.},

One of these stages is the intention retention stage, in which a person has to stay vigilant of the task and recognize when it can be carried out. Within the retention process there is the need to maintain groupings of tasks based on one’s areas of responsibility as well. To aid in task retention overall, external memory aids are often used. Still, there are occasions where intentions are not retained when external memory aids are used due to the aid’s inability to convey task information or cue execution of a task. In our work, we look to design an external memory aid that supports retention of individual task knowledge as well as retention of task knowledge in a user’s different areas of responsibility. With this tool we will observe its use to verify or deny its ability to support these two activities. We have conducted a survey of task management practices and results from the survey, along with related work, have aided in our initial design.},

One particular opportunity for water conservation is the shower, because depending on the shower head and shower habits, an individual can save many liters of fresh water each day. Feedback proved to be an effective method to promote sustainable behavior. Therefore, in this paper we suggest to promote water conservation by providing feedback in form of an ambient display that can easily be integrated in current shower types. We built a prototype to study the potential of such a feedback device. These shower water meter (show-me) display the amount of water, that is used during one shower in form of LEDs assembled on a stick. Thus, an increasing water level is visualized. The user study revealed two groups. The subjects who considered themselves as ecologically conscious changed their behavior and turned the water down or off while soaping. Also, they are willing to pursue this behavior. Other subjects who did not have the goal to act more sustainable, were surprised about their water consumption and tried to reduce it. However, after the removal of the show-me device they did not maintain their behavior and fell back into their previous habit.},

Voice coils facilitate the direct translation of auditory information onto the multiple discrete vibrotactile channels, which increases the potential to identify sections of the music that would otherwise be masked by the combined signal. One of the central goals of this work has been to improve accessibility to the emotional information expressed in music for users who are Deaf or hard of hearing. To this end, we present our prototype of the MHC, two models of sensory substitution to support the translation of existing and new music, and some of the design challenges encountered throughout the development process. Results of a series of experiments conducted to assess the effectiveness of the MHC are discussed, followed by an overview of future directions for this research.},

Most people interact with their own circle of friends at a range of different rates, and through a range of different modalities (by phone, instant messaging, face-to-face meetings etc.). When these naturally recurring interactions are maintained effectively, people feel at ease with the quality and stability of their social network. Conversely, when a person has not interacted with one of their friends for a longer period than they usually do, a problem can be identified in that relationship which may require action to fix. We present Stay-in-touch, an ambient information system which provides peripheral cues to the user which serve as occasional recommendations of which of their friends they should contact soon in order to keep their social network in a healthy state.},

This interface is intended to supplement or replace the textual searches that managers typically perform.

Inflatable Mouse functions just like a typical mouse; moreover, it provides new interaction techniques by sensing the air pressure in the balloon of the mouse. It also addresses some issues associated with pressure-sensing interactions such as the lack of bidirectional input and the lack of effective feedback. Moreover, it can be used as both a control tool and a display tool. In this paper, the design of an Inflatable Mouse prototype is described and potential application scenarios such as zooming in/out and fast scrolling using pressure control are explained.

We designed a system that detects tune and speed from a physical violin, and demonstrated three tangible music visualizations that children see in their daily lives, employing a flowerpot, plants and a picture of frame. We describe how the data captured from physical musical instruments can be seen through these objects, and suggest future possibilities for interactive sound visualization in music education for children with hearing impairments.},

To examine the effect of framing on individual’s productivity, we designed two versions of TimeAware, each with a different framing setting—one emphasizing productive activities (positive framing) and the other emphasizing distracting activities (negative framing), and conducted an eight-week deployment study (N = 24). We found a significant effect of framing on participants’ productivity: only participants in the negative framing condition improved their productivity. The ambient widget seemed to help sustain engagement with data and enhance self-awareness.

The FORE-Watch aims at adjusting the consumption behavior of energy users in 24 multi-person households and persuading them to change their timing of consumption activities; half of them were shown a forecast of the occupancy rate of the local energy grid (i.e., grid status), and the other half were shown how much energy will be delivered by green sources such as windmills (i.e., green energy). Our qualitative and quantitative survey and the energy consumption data revealed that the grid status group showed a more constant behavior than the green energy, indicating that the more dynamic forecast presentation did not lead to the same type of behavior change as the static forecast presentation. Overall, the FORE-Watch aroused awareness, attention and interest through permanent presence, clear and simple information, and changed the energy consumption behavior of our participants.},

We argue that this effect could only be enabled by involving providers and potential users in the design process of an ambient persuasive display, which aims to lower energy consumption. In this paper, we present the results of five expert interviews with energy consultants and a participatory design workshop with six potential consumers. We focused on the ideal persuasive strategies as the requirement. In here, we show the commonalities and differences between these two stakeholders, demonstrating the relevance of taking both sides into account in the design to support behavior change systems.},

Those environments often act autonomously to support a user’s activity based on context information gathered from ubiquitous sensors. The autonomous nature, their accessibility to large amounts of personal information, and the fact that actuators and sensors are invisibly embedded in such environments, raise several privacy issues for users. Those issues need to be addressed by adequate mechanisms for privacy protection and trust establishment. In this chapter, we provide an overview of existing privacy enhancing technologies (PETs) in the area of ambient intelligent environments and present novel adaptive privacy mechanisms as used in the ATRACO architecture and in an ambient calendar system. Further, we will discuss how computational trust mechanisms and social trust aspects can be utilized to support privacy protection and the establishment of trust between system components and between the system and users. After describing the integration of these mechanisms in the overall system architecture of ATRACO, we conclude by giving an outlook on future directions in this area.},

First, we conducted a storytelling competition to elicit future visions of how people imagined the role of technology. Second, we conducted a rapid ethnographic study using a mock-up prototype device in various public locations to gain a deeper understanding of how people would appropriate a specific technology, namely interactive public displays. Lastly, we collected ethnographic material through a diary study and interviews where people recorded their use of existing technology, and through these experiences, imagine how future technologies might affect their lives. We found that these methods proved useful in engaging a city's community to imagine the city's future. Consequently, we were able to explore the current use of technologies in the city and project their possible future use. Contrary to previous speculation in academic and cyberpunk literature, we conclude that digital technologies will not necessarily induce an abandonment of physical urban spaces. Rather, we project an increased sophistication in the sociable uses of urban spaces and technologies, where people blend their online and offline worlds into a single lived reality.},

Such games are increasing in popularity due to the wide adoption of smartphones that contain the location sensors necessary for their play. When played on a small, hand-held display, location-based games have two problems: users may be distracted, possibly leading to accidents; and players must map the display contents to the physical world, possibly reducing their sense of immersion. In this paper, we present the results of a study showing that ambient audio - a continuous stream of audio representing an entity in space - can replace visual displays for navigation tasks in location-based games. We find that ambient audio reduces player performance, but increases their sense of immersion in the virtual world and increases player safety.},

We hope to motivate immediate reduction in water use as well as higher-order behaviors (seeking new information, etc) through unobtrusive low-cost water flow sensing and several persuasive displays. Early prototypes were installed at public faucets and a private (shared) shower, logging water usage first without and then with ambient displays. This pilot study led to design iterations, culminating in long-term deployment of sensors in four private showers over the course of three weeks. Sensors first logged baseline water usage without visualization. Then, two display styles, ambient and numeric, were deployed in random order, each showing individual and average water consumption. Quantitative data along with participants’ feedback contrast the effectiveness of numeric displays against abstract visualization in this very important domain of water conservation and public health.},

The proposed model contributes to a better understanding of information aesthetics as a potentially independent research field within visualization that specifically focuses on the experience of aesthetics, dataset interpretation and interaction. The proposed model is based on analysing existing visualization techniques by their interpretative intent and data mapping inspiration. It reveals information aesthetics as the conceptual link between information visualization and visualization art, and includes the fields of social and ambient visualization. This model is unique in its focus on aesthetics as the artistic influence on the technical implementation and intended purpose of a visualization technique, rather than subjective aesthetic judgments of the visualization outcome. This research provides a framework for understanding aesthetics in visualization, and allows for new design guidelines and reviewing criteria.},

In a zone-based approach, users are provided with a various ranges of information, from ambient and graphics-based information to personal and text-based information depending on the zone the users are in. Users are given a subtle hint with abstract ambient information via messaging in an ambient public situation and are identified through an RFID on a tag inside the detection-zone. They can then read personal messages by actively manipulating the ID tag using gesture-based controls inside the interaction zone. To develop the Ambient Widget device, a tri-axis acceleration sensor was embedded into an ID tag, and seven different gesture interactions with the ID tag were classified to control events for message navigation. Ambient Widget was installed in the lobby area of an international conference so that the participants can communicate through AIS instead of the usual messaging boards. A user study was conducted to evaluate the usability of the components comprising Ambient Widget. 30 users participated in this assessment.},

    abstract = {Medication taking is a self-regulatory process that requires individuals to self-monitor their medication taking behaviors, but this can be difficult because medication taking is such a mundane, unremarkable behavior. Ubiquitous sensing systems have the potential to sense everyday behaviors and provide the objective feedback necessary for self-regulation of medication taking. We describe an unobtrusive sensing system consisting of a sensor-augmented pillbox and an ambient display that provides near real-time visual feedback about how well medications are being taken. In contrast to other systems that focus on reminding before medication taking, our approach uses feedback after medication taking to allow the individual to develop their own routines through selfregulation. We evaluated this system in the homes of older adults in a 10-month deployment. Feedback helped improve the consistency of medication-taking behaviors as well as increased ratings of self-efficacy. However, the improved performance did not persist after the feedback display was removed, because individuals had integrated the feedback display into their routines to support their self-awareness, identify mistakes, guide the timing of medication taking, and provide a sense of security that they are taking their medications well. Finally, we reflect on design considerations for feedback systems to support the process of self-regulation of everyday behaviors.},

    abstract = {Recent research in 3D user interfaces pushes towards immersive graphics and actuated shape displays. Our work explores the hybrid of these directions, and we introduce sublimation and deposition, as metaphors for the transitions between physical and virtual states. We discuss how digital models, handles and controls can be interacted with as virtual 3D graphics or dynamic physical shapes, and how user interfaces can rapidly and fluidly switch between those representations. To explore this space, we developed two systems that integrate actuated shape displays and augmented reality (AR) for co-located physical shapes and 3D graphics. Our spatial optical see-through display provides a single user with head-tracked stereoscopic augmentation, whereas our handheld devices enable multi-user interaction through video seethrough AR. We describe interaction techniques and applications that explore 3D interaction for these new modalities. We conclude by discussing the results from a user study that show how freehand interaction with physical shape displays and co-located graphics can outperform wand-based interaction with virtual 3D graphics.},

One way to improve teamwork is to provide dynamic feedback generated by automated analyses of behavior, such as language use. Such feedback can lead members to reflect on and subsequently improve their collaborative behavior, but might also distract from the task at hand. We have experimented with GroupMeter – a chatbased system that presents visual feedback on team members’ language use. Feedback on proportion of agreement words and overall word count was presented using two different designs. When receiving feedback, teams in our study expressed more agreement in their conversations and reported greater focus on language use as compared to when not receiving feedback. This suggests that automated, realtime linguistic feedback can elicit behavioral changes, offering opportunities for future research.},

In this paper, we envision a new method, LightTouch, by which a wearable can establish a secure connection to an ambient display, such as a television or a computer monitor, while ensuring the user’s intention to connect to the display. LightTouch uses standard RF methods (like Bluetooth) for communicating the data to display, securely bootstrapped via the visible-light communication (the brightness channel) from the display to the low-cost, low-power, ambient light sensor of a wearable. A screen ‘touch’ gesture is adopted by users to ensure that the modulation of screen brightness can be securely captured by the ambient light sensor with minimized noise. Wireless coordination with the processor driving the display establishes a shared secret based on the brightness channel information. We further propose novel onscreen localization and correlation algorithms to improve security and reliability. Through experiments and a preliminary user study we demonstrate that LightTouch is compatible with current display and wearable designs, is easy to use (about 6 seconds to connect), is reliable (up to 98\% success connection ratio), and is secure against attacks.},

BeWell promotes improved behavioral patterns via feedback rendered as an ambient display on the smartphone’s wallpaper. With BeWell+, we introduce new wellbeing mechanisms to address challenges identified during the initial deployment of the BeWell app; specifically, (i) community adaptive wellbeing feedback, which automatically generalize to diverse user communities (e.g., elderly, young adults, children) by balancing the need to promote better behavior yet remains realistic to the user’s goals; and, (ii) wellbeing adaptive energy allocation, which prioritizes monitoring fidelity and feedback responsiveness on specific health dimensions of wellbeing (e.g., social interaction) where the user needs most help. We evaluate the performance of these mechanisms as part of an initial deployment and user study that includes 27 people using BeWell+ over a 19 day field trial.

The unobtrusive display technique was prototyped with an interactive picture frame, which was used as a probe to chart the possibilities of the technique in an interview-based user study (n = 12) and an in-the-wild deployment (one couple) of people living remotely from their partner. The salient findings showed positive response especially on the non-light-emitting nature of the display, and indicates that this type of solution has the potential to support LDR communication and relationship through a pair of private, meaningful, and always-on yet calm displays.},

For movie theaters the notion of 4 dimensional (4D) films exist, describing a 3D movie that is enhanced with ambient feedback such as environmental light, air streams or moist.

While these systems are targeted at supporting the individual driver and his or her safety, they may though compete for the driver’s attention, and may demand too much of the driver’s cognitive resources. Based on the established multiple resource theory in recent years, the use of different multimodal displays has been investigated that give the driver attention while not overloading sensory channels. In our work, we are looking into peripheral light displays in means to present safety relevant information. In this paper, we present the results of an experiment in which a peripheral light display was used to show the distance to a closing vehicle. The display is an LED stripe, seamlessly integrated into the side door and the dashboard of the car. Two different light patterns were tested in an overtaking scenario in a driving simulator. One pattern encodes the expected time to collision to the left rear car by moving a light source towards the front left corner. The other pattern additionally adapts its brightness to a simplified model of the driver’s certainty to get his or her attention in uncertain situations. In contrast to previous works, we did not focus on a warning system but on a decision aid system. We found that using the adaptive pattern led to faster decisions and therefore to a smaller probability of violating safety distances. We believe that this pattern is a good basis for patterns which are fine-tuned to individual drivers as well as better driver models.},

This paper offers an introduction to the notion of ambient information display, and explores why and how the haptic channel could contribute. It begins with a discussion of the attentional problems posed by contemporary interface technology, and a broad overview of ambient interfaces themselves: their purpose, specification, features, and some general examples. Sense is made of the haptic ambient design space through a morphology of the functionality and social configurations exhibited by existing and envisioned examples. Finally, reflections on design principles and challenges for ambient haptic interfaces are aimed at inspiring, shaping, and informing future development in this area.},

SpectroFlexia is developed in an iterative design process which revealed a low-cost method of smoothly changing the color of light shining through translucent materials. Using this method, SpectroFlexia can display several types of digital information through the speed at which its colors change. In addition to providing peripheral information, SpectroFlexia is designed to serve a decorative function. An informal user exploration with an interactive prototype of SpectroFlexia indicated that smooth color transitions are a promising way of presenting peripheral information.},

Birds move according to users’ activity level, and the garden’s background changes according to each user’s sleeping habits. Users match peers perceived burnout, and sleep and activity habits to induce cognitive dissonance. We argue such displays are more efficient than personal devices to empower individuals’ self-reflection due their capabilities for enabling a playful interaction with their personal data.},

Ambient displays are abstract and aesthetic peripheral displays portraying non-critical information on the periphery of a user's attention. Although many innovative displays have been published, little existing work has focused on their evaluation, in part because evaluation of ambient displays is difficult and costly. We adapted a low-cost evaluation technique, heuristic evaluation, for use with ambient displays. With the help of ambient display designers, we defined a modified set of heuristics. We compared the performance of Nielsen's heuristics and our heuristics on two ambient displays. Evaluators using our heuristics found more, severe problems than evaluators using Nielsen's heuristics. Additionally, when using our heuristics, 3-5 evaluators were able to identify 40–60\% of known usability issues. This implies that heuristic evaluation is an effective technique for identifying usability issues with ambient displays.},

It is also a highly social matter, that blurs the traditional boundary between matter and function in a product, creates an experience, and enhances sensations. The workshop presented in this paper is an opportunity for the students to analyze the complexity of user experience related to ambient devices using smart materials. In order to provide a guideline to perform this analysis, an approach based on heuristic evaluation is proposed to the students.},

    abstract = {Information workers often have to balance many tasks and interruptions. In this work, we explore peripheral display techniques that improve multitasking efficiency by helping users maintain task flow, know when to resume tasks, and more easily reacquire tasks. Specifically, we compare two types of abstraction that provide different task information: semantic content extraction, which displays only the most relevant content in a window, and change detection, which signals when a change has occurred in a window (all designed as modifications to Scalable Fabric [17]). Results from our user study suggest that semantic content extraction improves multitasking performance more so than either change detection or our base case of scaling. Results also show that semantic content extraction provides significant benefits to task flow, resumption timing, and reacquisition. We discuss the implication of these findings on the design of peripheral interfaces that support multitasking.},

Our contribution is the investigation of these key characteristics, combined with a toolkit that encapsulates them and supports the design of displays that focus on these issues.

Our goal is to enable designers to explore different approaches to managing user attention. The PTK supports three issues specific to conveying information on the periphery of human attention. These issues are abstraction of raw input, rules for assigning notification levels to input, and transitions for updating a display when input arrives. Our contribution is the investigation of issues specific to attention in peripheral display design and a toolkit that encapsulates support for these issues.

However, the drawback of graphical navigation displays is that drivers have to explicitly glance at them, which can distract from a situation on the road. To decrease driver distraction while driving with a navigation system, we explore the use of ambient light as a navigation aid in the car, in order to shift navigation aids to the periphery of human attention. We investigated this by conducting studies in a driving simulator, where we found that drivers spent significantly less time glancing at the ambient light navigation aid than on a GUI navigation display. Moreover, ambient light-based navigation was perceived to be easy to use and understand, and preferred over traditional GUI navigation displays. We discuss the implications of these outcomes on automotive personal navigation devices.},

Their aim is to present information as unobtrusively as possible to avoid interrupting primary tasks (e.g. writing or reading). In recent years, light has been used to create ambient systems to display information. Examples of ambient light systems range from simple notification systems such as displaying messages or calendar event reminders, to more complex systems such as focusing on conveying information regarding health activity tracking. However, for ambient light systems, there is a broad design space that lacks guidelines on when to make use of light displays and how to design them. In this paper we provide a systematic overview of existing ambient light systems over four identified information classes derived from 72 existing ambient light systems. The most prominent encoding parameters among the surveyed ambient light systems are color, brightness, and their combination. By analyzing existing ambient light systems, we provide a first step towards developing guidelines for designing future ambient light systems.},

To date, methods do not exist for the reporting of e-waste to users of personal computing while they perform simple internet enquiries. Underpinning the theoretical development of this project is a focus on AD guided by a soundscape theory, and on approaches to sonification to convey subtle, unobtrusive, and useful information. Evaluation of the prototype takes place as a field study in an office context. The following paper gives an account of the design and development of the AD prototype and its respective sonification, the design methodology employed and the research findings, and concludes with recommendations for further exploration of the balance between ambient and salient information.},

The chase light (i.e., stripes of adjacent LEDs that are turned on and off frequently to give the illusion of lights moving along the stripe) provides ambient feedback to the driver about speed. We present a simulator based user study that uses three different types of feedback: (1) chase light with constant speed, (2) with proportional speed (i.e., chase light speed correlates with vehicle speed), and (3) with adaptive speed (i.e., chase light speed adapts to a target speed of the vehicle). Our results show that the adaptive condition is suited best to help a driver to control driving speed. The proportional speed condition resulted in a significantly slower mean speed than the baseline condition (no chase light).},

Taking advantage of and managing this information, however, is becoming increasingly challenging due to its volume and the variety of sources available. We attempt to reduce this overload with the InfoCanvas, an ambient display of a personalized, information-driven, visual collage. Through a web-based interface, people identify information of interest, associate a pictorial representation with it, and place the representation on a virtual canvas. The end result is an information collage, displayed on a secondary monitor or net appliance, that allows people to keep tabs on information in a calm, unobtrusive manner. This paper presents details on how a person can create and manage information with the InfoCanvas, and how we provide such capabilities.},

In collaborative ambient systems, blow displays direct the user to displays that provide rich information. Blow displays can also express information auxiliary to the main content the user is attending to. In this paper, we describe some ongoing applications and discuss their benefits and issues.},

A Microsoft Kinect-based tracking system is employed to detect users’ presence. Follow the Grass can be used for entertainment purposes by displaying animations through movement of the grass, as well as for indoor way-finding and ambient persuasive guidance. We present a number of scenarios with varying scales of interaction, and different applications, followed by a description of the initial hardware design of a single blade of grass and its actuated root. We will give a description of the tracking system, and how it tracks users and is capable of identifying individuals. Finally we will provide suggestions for the further development.},

This model is useful to clarify conceptual relationships between different visualization design approaches, ranging from traditional data representation applications over to ambient displays to visualization art experiences. This exchange of insights from related scientific and artistic fields forms the foundation for potential collaboration initiatives in research or educational contexts. Subsequently, this aesthetic data visualization model is explained and illustrated by various student works accomplished in several creative design visualization course units.},

    abstract = {The paper describes a pilot system for the detailed management of domestic electricity consumption aimed at minimizing demand peaks and consumer cost. Management decisions are made both interactively by consumers themselves, and where practical, automatically by computer. These decisions are based on realtime pricing and availability information, as well as current and historic usage data. The benefits of the energy strategies implied by such a system are elaborated, showing the potential for significant peak demand reduction and slowing of the need for growth in generation capacity. An overview is provided of the component technologies and interaction methods we have designed, but the paper focuses on the communication of real-time information to the consumer through a combination of specific and ambient visualizations. There is a need for both overview information (eg how much power is being used right now; how much energy have we used so far today; what does it cost?) and information at the point-of-use (is it OK to turn this dryer on now, or should I wait until later?). To assist the design of these visualizations, a survey is underway aimed at establishing people's understanding of power and energy concepts.},

The increase of incoming messages and continuous information updates often distracts us from our primary tasks and makes it challenging to stay focussed. A solution to this is to provide an overview of information updates in an unobtrusive manner, which does not require an immediate attention shift, but rather creates a continuous and overall awareness. One approach to provide such an awareness are ambient light displays, which address humans’ perception abilities to gain cues from our periphery. In this paper we present six examples, which investigate the use of ambient lights in different contexts and situations, such as household and office settings as well as mobile and social networking tasks.

We aim to support children in learning time with intuitive interaction with a prototype presenting time periods unobtrusively. We present Timelight, an ambient light display designed to help children better understand the duration of time periods. We derive requirements from interviews and a focus groups with teachers, parents and HCI experts. We establish an interaction design and develop a prototype for a field exploration study. We explore the functionality of and interaction with Timelight in families, kindergarten groups and school classes in a two-week field study. Our results show that ambient light is well suited to keep children updated on the duration of time in various contexts of their daily life. Our participants use Timelight on a vast range of occasions and identify additional roles for the display.},

Initially, content (videos, images and news) are presented in a random manner. Using cameras installed on the signs, the system observes the audience and detects if someone is watching the content (via face detection). The anonymous view time duration is then stored in a central database, together with date, time and sign location. When scheduling content, the signs calculate the expected view time for each content type depending on sign location and time using a Naive Bayes classifier. Content is then selected randomly, with the probability for each content weighted by the expected view time. The system has been deployed for two months on four digital signs in a university setting using semirealistic content \& content types. We present a first evaluation of this approach that concentrates on major effects and results from interviews with 15 users.},

In addition there is a need to provide abstract information, in context, to local and remote stakeholders. There are many different viewing options utilizing converged networks and the resulting explosion in data and information has resulted in a new problem, as these new ambient assisted living services struggle to convey meaningful information to different groups of end users.

However, while quantitative data representations (e.g., charts, graphs, and statistical reports) typify most health tools, growing evidence suggests such feedback can not only fail to motivate behavior but may also harm self-integrity and fuel negative mindsets about exercise. Our research seeks to devise alternative, more qualitative schemes for encoding personal information. In particular, this paper explores the design of data-driven narratives, given the intuitive and persuasive power of stories. We present WhoIsZuki, a smartphone application that visualizes physical activities and goals as components of a multi-chapter quest, where the main character’s progress is tied to the user’s. We report on our design process involving online surveys, in-lab studies, and in-the-wild deployments, aimed at refining the interface and the narrative and gaining a deep understanding of people’s experiences with this type of feedback. From these insights, we contribute recommendations to guide future development of narrative-based applications for motivating healthy behavior.},

Visualizations can help the user in making this decision, but we believe that conventional visualizations are less than ideal. In this article, we describe an interactive ambient visualization to help users identify, understand, and interpret soft advice. Our visualization was developed to help programmers interpret code smells, which are indications that a software project may be suffering from design problems. We describe a laboratory experiment with 12 programmers that tests several hypotheses about our visualization. The findings suggest that our tool helps programmers to identify smells more effectively and to make more informed judgments about the design of the program under development. We then describe an application of our visualization technique in another domain: an English style and grammar advisor. This second application suggests that our technique can be applied to several domains and also suggests how the technique must be varied to make it domain specific.},

Nabaztag was designed to be a "smart object" comparable to those manufactured by Ambient Devices; it can connect to the Internet (to download weather forecasts, read its owner's email, etc.). It is also customizable and programmable to an extent. Sylvain Huet developed most of the embedded code of all Violet objects. Sebastien Bourdeauducq developed the Wi-Fi driver. Antoine Schmitt has been their behavior designer and Jean-Jacques Birgé their sound designer (together they have also composed Nabaz'mob, an opera for 100 Nabaztag). Maÿlis Puyfaucher (who features its French voice) wrote all the original texts pronounced by the rabbit. On 20 October 2009, following a long period of technical difficulties that ultimately led to Violet's bankruptcy, Mindscape purchased Violet.In October 2010, Mindscape announced a third generation Nabaztag, called "Karotz". Karotz was released April 2012. On 27 July 2011, Mindscape stopped the maintenance of the Nabaztag and released its source code.On 23 December 2011, it was announced that the Nabaztag rabbits would be "coming back to life" on 24 December 2011 at midnight via email to those with Violet accounts. The required server service at Nabaztag.com has since stopped functioning, but other options exist including setting up a server using OpenNab software or installing NabaztagLives on a Raspberry Pi single-board computer.},

    abstract = {Organic User Interfaces (OUIs) are flexible, actuated interfaces characterized by being aesthetically pleasing, intuitively manipulated and ubiquitously embedded in our daily life. In this paper, we critically survey the state-of-the-art for OUIs in interactive architecture research at two levels: 1) Architecture and Landscape; and 2) Interior Design. We postulate that OUIs have specific qualities that offer great potential for building interactive interiors and entire architectures that have the potential to –finally– transform the vision of smart homes and ubiquitous computing environments (calm computing) into reality. We formulate a manifesto for OUI Architecture in both exterior and interior design, arguing that OUIs should be at the core of a new interdisciplinary field driving research and practice in architecture. Based on this research agenda we propose concerted efforts to be made to begin addressing the challenges and opportunities of OUIs. This agenda offers us the strongest means through which to deliver a future of interactive architecture.},

People can directly obtain information anytime from ubiquitous computer. However, conventional computing style with a keyboard and a mouse is not suitable for everyday use. We proposed and developed a Web browser called the AmbientBrowser system that supports people in their daily acquisition of knowledge. It continuously searches Web pages using both system-defined and user-defined keywords, and displays sensors detect users’ and environmental conditions and control the system’s behavior such as knowledge selection or a style of presentation. Thus, the user can encounter a wide variety of knowledge without active operations. It monitors the context of the environment, such as lighting conditions and temperature. In addition, it displays Web pages incrementally in proportion to the context. This paper describes the implementation of the AmbientBrowser system and discusses its effects.},

In the realm of personal architecture, bYOB is an interactive material that encourages users to explore and experiment by creating new objects to seamlessly integrate into their lives. The physical configuration of the object mediates its computational behavior. Therefore, an object built out of the system of modular elements understands its geometry and responds appropriately without any end-user programming. Our current prototype is a bag built out of the system that understands it is a bag when the handle is attached to the mesh of modules, responds by illuminating its fabric and inner contents when the sun goes down (Fig 1), communicates the presence of objects placed in the bag, and interacts with the user via speech. We describe how bYOB contributes to and differs from existing work in modular based systems and fabric interfaces. We discuss our development process in respect to physical, electronic, and conceptual design. We also describe salient features and future applications enabled by this new construction kit.},

As a result of using standardized interfaces, any UPnP control point may be used to invoke actions on virtual UPnP devices. Such devices are dynamically inserted to the environment and can be removed at run-time. Data delivered by sensors is interpreted by an environment monitoring component which routes higher-level atomic context information to virtual objects. As a result of invoked device actions and gathered context information, resulting state changes (e.g., switching light states) are visualized within the scene.},

Since classes are in a group setting, athletes may not receive the individual attention necessary to master correct form - an important factor to maximize exercise and avoid injury. In this paper, we investigate the potential of a wearable, ambient display technology, MuscleMemory, to help athletes maintain good form and improve communication in group-based, high intensity exercise communities. We explored the feasibility of MuscleMemory by contextually interviewing 14 high intensity exercise community members to understand when they need the most assistance and how communication between coaches and athletes can be improved. Participants thought MuscleMemory could be used to improve how coaches communicate with their athletes - especially to coordinate coaching between different coaches and provide objective feedback.},

The approach we are taking in answering this question is informed by the concept of collective intelligence (CI). We are applying the concept of CI to AmI as we have found it works well in biological and social systems. Examples from nature demonstrate the power of CI stimulated by implicit cues in the environment. We use these examples to derive design principles for AmI environments. By applying these design principles to a concrete scenario, we are able to propose ways to help decrease environmental pollution within urban areas.},

This frame contains a moving portrait of a person the employee loves or likes. It provides affective feedback in order to persuade employees for better sitting habits while working with a computer. We conducted a preliminary in-situ study, deploying these picture frames on the desktops of eight office employees.

    abstract = {Human-centered design teams must integrate diverse individual perspectives into a shared understanding during conceptual design. The team’s shared knowledge of their users becomes the basis for later design decisions. We conducted a formative study that shows how generic groupware is insufficient to support the transition from individual to collaborative creative work. We developed a set of design guidelines and implemented them in Dazzle, a collaborative shared display system for co-located design team meetings. Dazzle associates the action of showing information on the shared display with granting the rest of the team access to that information: showing is sharing. Dazzle also records a history of shown files. Team members can annotate this log using cross-platform synchronized clients. Teams of novice designers tested Dazzle over two consecutive sessions: the first focused on synthesizing user research, and the second focused on brainstorming. Dazzle was very effective at grounding team conversations about user research, but was used less for sharing information during brainstorming tasks. Items from the shared activity log were used as sources of inspiration and decision criteria during the brainstorming task. Future work includes additional support for active decisionmaking, and ambient feedback on design activity.},

While ambient displays are often treated and evaluated as solitary objects in existing literature, I will argue that the experience of an ambient display is not determined in the first place by its intrinsic qualities, but essentially by the way how it is situated within its local context. The six described strategies show how cultural notions and practices can be incorporated into the design of ambient displays. Some of them seem counterintuitive and …},

In this paper, we focus on the issue of information design for media façades, which is not often discussed separately. As a thought experiment, we propose homing in on this topic as a core domain for the deployment of low-resolution, ambient displays in the city. We discuss the advantages and limitations of five techniques for encoding information: color, movement, text, images, and shape. Though designers may not always be aiming to convey explicit information, onlookers may still seek additional layers of meaning and end-users may re-appropriate an infrastructure over time. Two examples from our recent practice, a series of single-pixel wayfinding beacons and a low-resolution media façade, serve to illustrate these techniques. By linking the broad notions of ‘content’ and ‘meaning’ to a set of purpose-driven and actionable parameters, we invite designers to scrutinize the low-level communication processes facilitated by media architecture.},

In this paper we present the design space of a display-augmented forearm, focusing on two specific properties of the forearm: its hybrid nature as a private and a public display surface and the way clothing influences information display. We show a wearable prototypical implementation along with interactions that instantiate the design space: sleeve-store, sleeve-zoom, public forearm display and interactive tattoo.},

CrossFlow is a crossmodal ambient display prototype for indoor navigation, that exploits aspects of crossmodal cognition in providing users with the facility to decode temporally multiplexed information in an animated ambient display. We describe a number of benefits of crossmodal ambient displays relating to both privacy and performance. Initial user studies have demonstrated that, compared to traditional navigation aids such as maps, crossmodal displays have the potential to significantly enhance the navigation performance of users whilst at the same time leading to a reduction on the cognitive load imposed by tasks such as navigation.},

In this paper, we present the design of an always-on ecofeedback display, PowerViz, that provides information about people’s power usage in their homes at an appliance level. In our study, we found that PowerViz increased awareness towards energy consumption, gave householders a better understanding of high consumption devices and made it easy for them to isolate and respond to unnecessary or “greedy” appliances by turning them off or changing their use patterns. We also found that an ambient display of the household’s total current electricity use both informed and attracted people to use the system when power usage became unusually high.},

    abstract = {Decisions about what to eat are often made close to mealtime, when hunger clouds people’s ability to think creatively or conscientiously about their meal choices. As a result, people we studied tended to resort to “everyday meals”: recipes that are tasty, quick, and cheap. These choices often run counter to cooks’ stated values regarding health, variety, ingredient choice, and so forth, but are chosen for their convenience and familiarity. This lack of variety seemed to stem from a scarcity of “everyday” recipes compounded by the fact that usually, at the time they are preparing the meal, cooks are tired, hungry, and don’t want to search for or try less familiar recipes. Based on a study of current cooking practices, we developed the SuChef prototype: a low-fidelity probe supporting the in-kitchen display of everyday meal ideas along with the sharing of recipes among members of social groups. The probe was deployed for a week among 5 geographically dispersed but socially connected households and yielded insights into the design space for technology to support everyday cooking.},

Each BodyPod consists of a flexible surface with six pressure-sensitive and light-emitting pads that adjusts its shape to the body anatomy. As a person’s body moves, limbs exert different pressure on each pad creating a live digital “bodyprint” that is mapped on the pads of other BodyPods through color and light.

However, few efforts to develop tools for enhancing clinician communication have focused on nonverbal aspects of the clinical encounter. We describe a novel system that both uses social signal processing technology (SSP) to capture nonverbal cues in real time and displays ambient visual feedback on control and affiliation-two primary, yet distinct dimensions of interpersonal nonverbal communication. To explore clinicians' acceptance of and reaction to an ambient visual feedback from such a system, we conducted a Wizard-of-Oz lab study to simulate system use with 16 healthcare professionals. We further followed up with 7 of those participants and iterated on the design with a new visualization. Our results indicate that reflective visual feedback on nonverbal communication provides an acceptable way to provide clinicians with awareness of their nonverbal communication. Furthermore, we discuss implications for the design of visual feedback to encourage empathic patient-centered communication.},

The ability of this technology to subtly and ubiquitously change the color of the fabric itself has made us able to merge different fields and technologies with AmbikKraf. In addition, with an animated room divider screen, Ambikraf merged its technology with Japanese Byobu art to tighten the gap between traditional arts and contemporary technologies. Through few this AmbiKraf Byobu art installation and other installations we discuss the impact of this technology as a ubiquitous fabric display.

Currently, such Internet-connected objects or `things' outnumber both people and computers connected to the Internet and their population is expected to grow to 50 billion in the next 5 to 10 years. To be able to develop IoT applications, such `things' must become dynamically integrated into emerging information networks supported by architecturally scalable and economically feasible Internet service delivery models, such as cloud computing. Achieving such integration through discovery and configuration of `things' is a challenging task. Towards this end, we propose a Context-Aware Dynamic Discovery of \{Things\} (CADDOT) model. We have developed a tool SmartLink, that is capable of discovering sensors deployed in a particular location despite their heterogeneity. SmartLink helps to establish the direct communication between sensor hardware and cloud-based IoT middleware platforms. We address the challenge of heterogeneity using a plug in architecture. Our prototype tool is developed on an Android platform. Further, we employ the Global Sensor Network (GSN) as the IoT middleware for the proof of concept validation. The significance of the proposed solution is validated using a test-bed that comprises 52 Arduino-based Libelium sensors.},

For three days, we exposed 15 subjects to a continual vibration pattern that was created by a mobile device worn in their trouser pocket. In order to guarantee that the stimuli would not require the subjects focal attention, the vibration pattern was tested and refined to minimise its obtrusiveness, and during the study, the participants adjusted its intensity to just above their personal detection threshold. At random times, the vibration stopped and participants had to acknowledge these events as soon as they noticed them. Only 6.5\% of the events were acknowledged fast enough to assume that the cue had been on the focus of the participants’ attention. The majority of events were answered between 1 and 10 minutes, which indicates that the participants were aware of the cue without focussing on it. In addition, participants reported not to be annoyed by the signal in 94.4\% of the events. These results provide evidence that vibration patterns can form non-annoying, lightweight information displays, which can be consumed at the periphery of a users attention.},

In particular, it is envisioned as an alternative to the carrying of laptops and to the installation of displays in furniture, objects, and walls.

We conducted an evaluation of the InfoCanvas, a peripheral display that conveys awareness information graphically as a form of information art, by assessing how well people recall information when it is presented for a brief period of time. We compare performance of the InfoCanvas to two other electronic information displays, a Web portal style and a text-based display, when each display was viewed for a short period of time. We found that participants noted and recalled significantly more information when presented by the InfoCanvas than by either of the other displays despite having to learn the additional graphical representations employed by the InfoCanvas.},

Novel sensing approaches which go beyond direct touch enable wider use of casual interactions, which will often be ‘around device' interactions. We consider the degree to which previous commercial products and research prototypes can be considered as fitting the focused– casual framework, and describe the properties using control theoretic concepts.

    abstract = {Information visualization has often focused on providing deep insight for expert user populations and on techniques for amplifying cognition through complicated interactive visual models. This paper proposes a new subdomain for infovis research that complements the focus on analytic tasks and expert use. Instead of work-related and analytically driven infovis, we propose Casual Information Visualization (or Casual Infovis) as a complement to more traditional infovis domains. Traditional infovis systems, techniques, and methods do not easily lend themselves to the broad range of user populations, from expert to novices, or from work tasks to more everyday situations. We propose definitions, perspectives, and research directions for further investigations of this emerging subfield. These perspectives build from ambient information visualization [32], social visualization, and also from artistic work that visualizes information [41]. We seek to provide a perspective on infovis that integrates these research agendas under a coherent vocabulary and framework for design. We enumerate the following contributions. First, we demonstrate how blurry the boundary of infovis is by examining systems that exhibit many of the putative properties of infovis systems, but perhaps would not be considered so. Second, we explore the notion of insight and how, instead of a monolithic definition of insight, there may be multiple types, each with particular characteristics. Third, we discuss design challenges for systems intended for casual audiences. Finally we conclude with challenges for system evaluation in this emerging subfield.},

We created Tableau Machine (TM) to explore the parts of home life that are unrelated to accomplishing tasks. Task support for “smart homes” has inspired many researchers in the community. We consider design for experience, an orthogonal dimension to task-centric home life. TM produces abstract visualizations on a large LCD every few minutes, driven by a set of four overhead cameras that capture a sense of the social life of a domestic space. The openness and ambiguity of TM allow for a cycle of co-interpretation with householders. We report on three longitudinal deployments of TM for a period of six weeks. Participant families engaged with TM at the outset to understand how their behaviors were influencing the machine, and, while TM remained puzzling, householders interacted richly with TM and its images. We extract some key design implications for an experience-focused smart home.},

Extending InfoVis into a product design can fill up the small screen on the product and make the product more user friendly. Appling the 3D form of industrial design to InfoVis can bring it to the physical world and enhance the information qualify in our lives. We also argue that there could be a harmonious combination of industrial design and InfoVis that integrate the benefits from both.

    abstract = {We introduce ideas, proposed technologies, and initial results for an office of the future that is based on a unified application of computer vision and computer graphics in a system that combines and builds upon the notions of the CAVE™, tiled display systems, and image-based modeling . The basic idea is to use real-time computer vision techniques to dynamically extract per-pixel depth and reflectance information for the visible surfaces in the office including walls, furniture, objects, and people, and then to either project images on the surfaces, render images of the surfaces , or interpret changes in the surfaces. In the first case, one could designate every-day (potentially irregular) real surfaces in the office to be used as spatially immersive display surfaces, and then project high-resolution graphics and text onto those surfaces. In the second case, one could transmit the dynamic image-based models over a network for display at a remote site. Finally, one could interpret dynamic changes in the surfaces for the purposes of tracking, interaction, or augmented reality applications. To accomplish the simultaneous capture and display we envision an office of the future where the ceiling lights are replaced by computer controlled cameras and “smart” projectors that are used to capture dynamic image-based models with imperceptible structured light techniques, and to display high-resolution images on designated display surfaces. By doing both simultaneously on the designated display surfaces, one can dynamically adjust or autocalibrate for geometric, intensity, and resolution variations resulting from irregular or changing display surfaces, or overlapped projector images. Our current approach to dynamic image-based modeling is to use an optimized structured light scheme that can capture per-pixel depth and reflectance at interactive rates. Our system implementation is not yet imperceptible, but we can demonstrate the approach in the laboratory. Our approach to rendering on the designated (potentially irregular) display surfaces is to employ a two-pass projective texture scheme to generate images that when projected onto the surfaces appear correct to a moving head- tracked observer. We present here an initial implementation of the overall vision, in an office-like setting, and preliminary demonstrations of our dynamic modeling and display techniques.},

For example, how will the robot alter how people use or perceive the environment, or how people will interact with the robot itself?

    abstract = {Physical inactivity and chronic stress at work increase the risks of developing metabolic disorders, mental illnesses, and musculoskeletal injuries, threatening office workers’ physical and psychological well-being. Although several guidelines and interventions have been developed to prevent theses subhealth issues, their effectiveness and health benefits are largely limited when they cannot match workday contexts. This paper presents LightSit, a health-promoting system that helps people reduce physically inactive behaviors and manage chronic stress at work. LightSit comprises a sensor mat that can be embedded into an office chair for measuring a user’s sitting posture and heart rate variability and a lighting display that is integrated into a monitor stand to present information unobtrusively, facilitating fitness and relaxation exercises during microbreaks. Following the showroom approach, we evaluated LightSit during a public exhibition at Dutch Design Week 2018. During the eight days of the exhibition, we observed more than 500 sessions of experiences with healthy microbreaks using our prototype. Semistructured interviews were conducted with 50 participants who had office-based jobs and had experienced LightSit. Our qualitative findings indicated the potential benefits of LightSit in facilitating health-promoting behaviors during office work. Based on the insights learned from this study, we discuss the implications for future designs of interactive health-promoting systems.},

In contrast to conventional monitoring systems a display embedded in a standard art frame presents the current room climate on the basis of classical art. Changing room conditions are reflected in the painting in real-time.

    abstract = {Indoor air quality has a significant effect on human performance. In addition, many health issues can be traced back to bad indoor room-climate. However, especially in Europe, pupils spend a majority of their learning life in school classes affected by poor room climate. Without an automatic heating, ventilation and air conditioning system these pupils and their teachers have to rely on manual ventilation by opening windows. Thereby, they often lack fundamental room climate quality information to effectively guide their behavior. Information systems (IS) and sensor technology can be a remedy to these challenges. Existing room climate monitoring systems regularly reveal major shortcomings, e.g. in respect to user interfaces, presentation of data, and systematic engagement. We want to address the aforementioned shortcomings and present an art IS, which reflects room conditions in real time through modifications of depicted art. The artifact is evaluated in a field experiment, conducted in an Austrian grammar school. The evaluation reveals that room climate measured in CO2 can indeed be improved significantly. In addition, pupils also perceive a significant room climate improvement.},

One promising approach for providing feedback about residential energy consumption is the use of ambient and artistic visualizations. Pervasive computing technologies enable the integration of such feedback into the home in the form of distributed point-of-consumption feedback devices to support decision-making in everyday activities. However, introducing these devices into the home requires sensitivity to the domestic context. In this paper we describe three abstract visualizations and suggest four design requirements that this type of device must meet to be effective: pragmatic, aesthetic, ambient, and ecological. We report on the findings from a mixed methods user study that explores the viability of using ambient and artistic feedback in the home based on these requirements. Our findings suggest that this approach is a viable way to provide resource use feedback and that both the aesthetics of the representation and the context of use are important elements that must be considered in this design space.},

Considering these characteristics of elders, we propose Ambient Information Systems (AIS) as the appropriate technology to assist elders, since they are aesthetically pleasing applications which provide users with abstract representations of valued information. The aim of this work was to identify the design issues that should be addressed for developing AIS that effectively assist elderly with their ADLs. To reach this end, we designed mobile and embedded AIS that help elderly to manage their medication, since it is one of the critical ADLs for enabling “ageing in place”. As a result of designing AIS, we identified a set of design attributes that were validated and extended through inspection evaluations with Computer Science and Health professionals.},

The rationale was to push people towards a desired behavior at the point of decision-making and to reflect upon theirs and others’ aggregate behavior. We describe the ambient displays that were developed and the prototyping studies in which they were evaluated. The findings from an in-the-wild study are then presented. They reveal that even though people said they were not aware of changing their behavior, logged data of their actual behavior showed a significant change. We discuss these mixed findings in relation to whether ambient displays can influence at an unconscious or conscious level.},

We evaluated the BioCrystal during a 2week, in situ multi-method study during which ten users collected over 115 hours of usable data. Users’ comments suggested high utility of such a biofeedback device for self-awareness, stress-management and interpersonal communication. Quantitative data confirmed that the BioCrystal met the criteria of an ambient display, and significantly improved users’ ability to control their stress.

The Digital Family Portrait (DFP) is one approach to providing peace of mind that has shown promise. To date, research on the DFP has been limited to wizard-of-oz based experiments over short periods of time. This paper describes a DFP field trial in which a private home was instrumented with sensors rather than relying on input from wizard-of-oz technology. This field trial was conducted over a period of one year between an aging parent living alone in her own home and her adult child living 50 miles distant.},

The reactive surface consists of hinged paper pieces situated in front of each fan. When activated by sonic elements in the environment, including sounds intentionally generated by an interactor, Murmur responds by turning on and off its fans in a sequence. The wind pressure generated by the movement of the fans stimulates the surface, forcing the paper up and out to create a variety of dynamic patterns. Each pattern represents characteristics of the sonic environment. We also analyze the feedback received from the interactors and discuss the possible ways of making the interaction more immersive.},

When the user comes within an appropriate range for interaction, the display shows pictures that are related to the user and provides quasi-3D navigation using the TIP (tour into the picture) method. In addition, menus can be manipulated directly on a touch-screen or remotely using an air mouse. In an emergency, LEDs around the display flash to alert the user.},

Human change behavior to others depending on others' psychological state estimated from the face and action. if the face and action of them is blinded, they can not take a preferable action to them. Recently, the technology to change behavior of people implicitly based on computer-generated ancient information and stimulations that prompts physical senses to have been studied in virtual reality. These studies aim to adopt their behavior to their surrounding environment mainly. The technologies to adopt their behavior to the individual in the context of his/her psychological state have not really investigated. We focused on comic book images as ambient information. The creative use of image of background in comic have an ability to describe and communicate various psychological states or situation of characters in the comic. We hypothesized that communicating of comic book images that describes personal psychological states enable us to understand the state and induce the preferred behavior in real world. Based on the hypothesis, we construct a system named “Psynteraction Chair,” which is a system to estimate and present psychological states of a user using comic book images to people around of the user. “Psynteraction Chair” estimates the level of concentration of the user. A comic book image which represents the most suitable psychological state is projected on the back of the chair based on the level of user's concentration. We tested how Psynteraction Chair influences in communication of the user and people around the user. As the result, the system realized that comic book images used in the experiment affect impression of the user's psychological state that people around the user of the system had. Also the possibility that projected comic book images can induce the people's behavior to the user was suggested.},

This phenomena is changing the way we live, work, and interact. This creates, not only technological opportunities for smarter cities, but also interactional opportunities for the citizens. However, designing, developing, and deploying urban computing projects in the wild, outside the controlled research environment, is challenging, due to the complexity of the urban context as well as the people who live in it. What are the ways to trigger and increase the public towards active participation or technological uptake in urban computing? How to design and structure participation for urban computing research and technologies in the wild for it to lead to mass participation with its citizens? These are the questions that are investigated in this paper. We present a survey on existing approaches in engaging participations and devising interactions with a range of existing urban computing technologies: smartphones, public displays, cyber physical systems (including those with embedded systems, sensors, and actuators), and Internet of Things. Based on the reviews, we propose a taxonomy for categorising and characterising urban computing technologies and approaches with regards to the level of participation they stimulate, the participation scale they support, the manipulation and effects mode they enable, and the interaction mode and scale they enable. Finally, strategies for structuring and engendering participations and interactions based on our own experience from deploying small to large scale urban computing projects in the wild are presented in this paper.},

Twenty-four non-anaesthetist participants with high or low levels of musical training were trained to monitor visual and auditory displays of patients’ vital signs. In nine anaesthesia test scenarios, participants were asked every 50–70 s whether one of five vital signs was abnormal and the trend of its direction. Abnormality judgements were unaffected by music or musical training. Trend judgements were more accurate when music was playing (p = 0.0004). Musical participants reported trends more accurately (p = 0.004), and non-musical participants tended to benefit more from music than did the musical participants (p = 0.063). Music may provide a pitch and rhythm standard from which participants can judge changes in vital signs from auditory displays. Nonetheless, both groups reported that it was easier to monitor the patient with no music (p = 0.0001), and easier to rely upon the auditory displays with no music (p = 0.014).},

It also introduces user movement as a natural user interface. To demonstrate the utility and effectiveness of the system, we constructed location/user-aware visitor-guide services and experimented with them for two weeks in a public museum.

    abstract = {Besides saving energy, using it at the right time (i.e. when there is a supply surplus, and the power is produced by sustainable power sources such as hydroelectricity or wind) is an important possibility to achieve positive effects for the environment. To enable the user to align their behavior with the dynamics of the energy generation they need to be informed about the current status of power supply and grid capacity. Furthermore, to be able to plan their behavior and possibly delay or advance consumption activities to more proper moments they also need to have access to high-quality forecasts about the future status of green energy supply. In this paper we present an ambient display design solution based on a common watch that is optimized for providing this information in an unobtrusive, ambient and persuasive way. We present and discuss requirements identified by use of literature analysis, focus groups and end-user questionnaires, outline approaches to calculate basic power generation forecasts based on weather forecast data and present an ambient interface concept designed to meet the identified requirements. We conclude that the developed approach has high potential to support desired behavior changes, and that achieving acceptable accuracy levels for the generation forecast is feasible with relatively little effort.},

However, existing research shows a lack of experience with software visualization tools in commercial settings. To our current knowledge, there is no study which examines ambient displays in Scrum teams with a longitudinal approach in order to address challenges in awareness and informal communication. A mixed-methods field study, which began in February 2014, is currently being conducted in cooperation with a medium-sized software company near Hamburg, Germany.

The system reliably produces single bubbles of specific sizes along a directed path. Each bubble produced by SensaBubble is filled with fog containing a scent relevant to the notification. The chrono-sensory aspect of SensaBubble means that information is presented both temporally and multimodally. Temporal information is enabled through two forms of persistence: firstly, a visual display projected onto the bubble which only endures until it bursts; secondly, a scent released upon the bursting of the bubble slowly disperses and leaves a longer-lasting perceptible trace of the event. We report details of SensaBubble’s design and implementation, as well as results of technical and user evaluations. We then discuss and demonstrate how SensaBubble can be adapted for use in a wide range of application contexts – from an ambient peripheral display for persistent alerts, to an engaging display for gaming or education.},

We present a system based on opportunistically located ambient lights that assist inhabitants of a smart home in answering this question. In this paper, we show the concept of our system and the inhabitant-centered design process behind the development. The system was installed in a one-family smart home.

    abstract = {While most homes are inherently social places, existing devices designed to control consumer electronics typically only support single user interaction. Further, as the number of consumer electronics in modern homes increases, people are often forced to switch between many controllers to interact with these devices. To simplify interaction with these devices and to enable more collaborative forms of device control, we propose an integrated remote control system, called CRISTAL (Control of Remotely Interfaced Systems using Touch-based Actions in Living spaces). CRISTAL enables people to control a wide variety of digital devices from a centralized, interactive tabletop system that provides an intuitive, gesture-based interface that enables multiple users to control home media devices through a virtually augmented video image of the surrounding environment. A preliminary user study of the CRISTAL system is presented, along with a discussion of future research directions.},

The motivation to build these devices is grounded in a historical reinterpretation of street lighting. Before fixed infrastructure illuminated cities at night, people carried lanterns with them to make their presence known. Using this as our starting point, we asked how we might engage people in more actively shaping the lightscapes which surround them. We prototyped a first iteration of sound and vibration responsive, LED-based coloured lights that we placed in three different settings including a choreographed dance performance, an outdoor public installation and an audio-visual event. We report on our experiences with these preliminary investigations.},

In this paper, we explore the potential of physically instantiated pixels that enable flexible, reconfigurable, unbounded, low-resolution, and responsive urban displays. Urban Pixels are nodes in a wireless network of physical pixels for urban spaces. Each pixel unit includes a microcontroller, RF transceiver (433 MHz), LED module (ten bright, white LEDs), rechargeable Li-Ion battery pack, IR sensor and renewable energy source such as photo-voltaic cells. Two acrylic half-spheres (4inch diameter) protect the components from the elements. No additional wiring is needed for communication and the units can be mounted individually to any surface. A smallscale prototype network of fifty Urban Pixels was displayed on a façade of Eden Court Theater in Inverness, Scotland from June 1 – June 7, 2008. The public was encouraged to change display patterns via SMS or to interact with individual units via flashlights. We observed and informally interviewed theater guests and passers-by interacting with the façade for several nights. Based on these results, we outline an exciting problem space for designing displays and lighting systems in cities.},

Importantly these displays need to be designed to seamlessly fit into their environment and should not interrupt an individual from their primary task. The first Ambient Information System, known as the “Dangling String” was described in the literature in 1996. Since this time a number of different systems have been reported. In this paper we re-examine the concepts, definitions and background to this field that have developed over the last 20 years by performing a detailed narrative review of the field. As a result we provide a detailed discussion on the key design features or dimensions that have been used to help categorise and evaluate such displays. We also examine 36 previously reported Ambient Information Systems and categorise them in terms of an existing taxonomy of design patterns for such systems. A benefit of this taxonomy approach is that it helps us identify an underutilised design area for these displays and leads us to propose a new design pattern, known as the “Aesthetic Awareness Display” to assist in the design of these systems. This type of Ambient Display uses metaphors in order to encode a few data elements into an aesthetically pleasing display with the goal of raising general awareness about the data.},

The WaveWatch display uses high-quality graphics and adopts a novel metaphor for visualizing variations in web traffic by representing the underlying dynamics with different levels of ocean wave activity. The abstract wave scene is intended to be informative but also provide a calming rather than distracting background in the work place. Here we report the results of a two-week in-situ deployment of the display. The results of this evaluation indicate the efficacy of the display in terms of our key design criteria, namely, aesthetics, business relevance of data, peripheral non-alarming operation and the overall utility of the display.},

We then examine various approaches for measuring cognitive load before describing a study that investigates a novel use of a dual-task measure to evaluate the cognitive load of a specific Ambient Display. A betweensubjects design with 40 participants was used, with the Ambient Display active for half of these participants. All participants completed three different primary tasks (n-back, visual digit span, and auditory digit span) alongside the secondary, Detection Response Task. The results show that the n-back task is the most appropriate for manipulating primary task load when evaluating such displays and that the dual-task paradigm can be used to provide an objective measure of workload. Analysis of the participants primary and secondary task performance indicates that the evaluated Ambient Display imposed no additional cognitive load.},

We introduce BeatIt, a novel technique that allows users to use passive, everyday objects to control a smart environment by recognizing the sounds generated from knocking on the objects. BeatIt uses a BeatSet, a series of percussive sound samples, to represent the sound signature of knocking on an object. A user associates a BeatSet with an event. For example, a user can associate the BeatSet of knocking on a door with the event of turning on the lights. Decoder, a signal-processing module, classifies the sound signals into one of the recorded BeatSets, and then triggers the associated event. Unlike prior work, BeatIt can be implemented on microphone-enabled commodity devices. Our user studies with 12 participants showed that our proofof-concept implementation based on a smartwatch could accurately classify eight BeatSets using a user-independent classifier.},

    abstract = {Sonification is an emerging modality of information representation, the auditory equivalent of visualization employing non-speech sound to display attributes of form, pattern, recurrence and trends in abstract data. Like data-art or visual and auditory art-forms driven by data content directly mapped to their rendering, sonification shares the goal of aesthetic representation (auditory graphing) in a way to better and more accessibly convey the message to broader consumer audiences. Often, the simple re-contextualization of dense abstract data in an auditory graph (or sonification) is sufficient to highlight long-term trends, to hear regularities (patterns) and anomalies in periodicity of time-series data and to assimilate very subtle and fine transformations. Sonification is also optimal for certain working or ambient situations that are visually rich or visually saturated, when we seek to command topical and peripheral attention with relevant cues. Auditory display is also an alternative to visualization for people with visual impairments. Exploring the premise that sonification should be both aesthetic and informative, i.e. listenable, attractive and engaging, this paper summarises the findings of 3 experiments conducted to determine ways to better represent and access dense information mapped on to more than one concurrent stream of information. Specifically, we show evidence that spatialization of informative events coinciding in time can be more clearly distinguished and that timbre (or tone colour / tone quality) characteristics can serve to further reinforce spatial and stream separation. These findings combine to develop comprehensible methods for representing complex data-sets. We consider human cognition, auditory perception and audio reproduction technologies that each influence the ability to display information sonically.},

    abstract = {In recent years, researchers have created different systems aimed at supporting a drivers’ decision-making process without creating additional distractions. Various approaches use in-car ambient light displays to convey information or offer suggestions about traffic situations. Developers of such systems often use lo-fi prototypes, such as paper sketches, or hi-fi prototypes, such as integrated light displays, to discuss and test ideas. Between lo-fi and hi-fi, we propose the use of a downscaled car equipped with a light display as a prototype. This can be used to easily create and evaluate in-vehicle light patterns and thus supports their design process. In this work, we present our working prototype and results of two user tests: the first one with developers during design exploration and the second one with a group of drivers evaluating given light patterns. Our results indicate that the prototype helps to better understand and discuss light patterns.},

Our work is motivated by the need to re-engage drivers in the driving task, e.g., in situations where manoeuvering the vehicle is straightforward and does not require high levels of engagement. CoastMaster supports drivers during speed limit changes by (a) re-engaging them in the driving task, and; (b) providing feedback on driving behaviour. In a simulator study (N=24), we compare a gamified and a non-gamified interface with regards to user experience, driving performance, and visual distraction. Our results indicate an increase in hedonic quality and driver engagement as well as a decrease in speed violations through the gamified condition. At the same time, the gamified version leads to longer glances towards the display suggesting visual distraction. Our study findings inform specific design recommendations for ambient interfaces and gamified driving.},

    abstract = {Research in ambient intelligent systems faces a challenging endeavor, namely the evaluation of user experience of ambient displays. Due to the fact that ambient displays should be unobtrusive, it is hard for users to appraise them on a reflective level (i.e. interviews and questionnaires). In this paper we present a methodological approach that combines an implicit (the Affect Misattribution Procedure (AMP)) and an explicit measurement technique (questionnaire for the persuasive effect (PeQ)) to tackle this problem. We used this approach in a study of an interface (Operator Guide) that provides information to operators in a semiconductor factory. Results show that the implicit technique is better suited to assess fine attitudinal differences on how users experience the display than explicit questionnaires. However, explicit measures are valuable to gain suggestions for improvements and thus it is concluded that this method triangulation adds value for the research on ambient persuasive interfaces.},

The issues are: 1) supporting informal communication and atmosphere in organisations, 2) the role and potential of ambient displays in future work environments, and 3) the combination of mostly static artefacts that are integrated in the architectural environment with mobile devices carried by people. Our results can be considered as steps towards the design and realization of what we call “social architectural spaces” in the context of future work environments. These environments will be populated with a range of different smart artefacts that are designed to facilitate awareness and notification as well as informal communication. We address a range of spaces in office buildings including public spaces, e.g., in the hallway, the foyer, and the cafeteria that have not been the focus of research so far. In particular, we present two artefacts: the Hello.Wall, a wall-size large ambient display, and the ViewPort, a mobile handheld device. They are interacting with each other via wireless networks and different types of sensing technology. The artefacts and the software were developed in the EU-funded “Disappearing Computer”project “Ambient Agoras: Dynamic Information Clouds in a Hybrid Worlds”.},

Our research question is to what extent the type of feedback representation affects collaborative processes. Two different representations have been created and compared in a user study: a diagram and a metaphor. In the diagram version the quality rating for each person is explicitly shown in charts and numbers. In the metaphorical representation feedback is implicitly visualized by changing certain characteristics of a pictorial scene. The results show that the metaphoric group mirror was not only more popular than the diagram, it also had a greater impact on the group behavior. When receiving negative feedback from the metaphoric group mirror, a correction of behavior was made significantly faster than with the diagram. Furthermore, both group mirrors had a positive effect on the self-regulation of the group compared to the baseline condition without feedback.},

Whereas an initial version was evaluated using wizards to obtain the required information about gazing behaviour and speaking activity instead of perceptual systems, in the current paper we employ a system including automated perceptual components. We describe the system properties and the perceptual components. The service was evaluated in a within-subjects experiment, where groups of participants discussed topics of general interest, with a total of 82 participants. It was found that the presence of the feedback about speaking time influenced the behaviour of the participants in such a way that it made over-participators to behave less dominant and under-participators to become more active. Feedback on eye gaze behaviour did not affect participants’ gazing behaviour (both for listeners and for speakers) during the meeting.},

Although handheld devices are an important platform for interface agents, their displays are inadequate for many pervasive computing tasks and need to be supplemented by larger high-resolution displays. We propose the notion of augmenting indoor intelligent environments with ambient projection, where large numbers of projectors simultaneously illuminate the environment from multiple directions — analogous to the way in which ambient lighting permeates a room. Ambient projection could enable any suitable surface in an environment to be employed as a display device. Using such displays, the intelligent environment could present high-resolution information, proactively alert users who are not carrying handheld devices and annotate objects in the environment without instrumentation. Several challenges must be solved before such projected displays become a practical solution. This paper provides an overview of our research in computer vision for enabling interactive ambient projected displays.},

This paper investigates the role of physically dynamic bar charts and evaluates new interactions for exploring and working with datasets rendered in dynamic physical form. To facilitate our exploration we constructed a 10×10 interactive bar chart and designed interactions that supported fundamental visualisation tasks, specifically: annotation, navigation, filtering, comparison, organization, and sorting. The interactions were evaluated in a user study with 17 participants. We identify the preferred methods of working with the data for each task (e.g. directly tapping rows to hide bars), highlight the strengths and limitations of working with physical data, and discuss the challenges of integrating the proposed interactions together into a larger data exploration system. In general, physical interactions were intuitive, informative, and enjoyable, paving the way for new explorations in physical data visualizations.},

We conducted a design study around these two questions. Our results show that participants designed different screen shapes that varied based upon peoples’ distance from the display and the content shown. Shapes ranged primarily between flat, separated, concave, L-shape and convex displays. Based on our findings, we designed a dynamic display that changes to these and other configurations. Shape-shifting is controlled either by explicit interaction (where the display responds to hand gestures) or implicitly (where the display infers a shape based both on its content and the sensed positions of the people around it). Overall, we contribute: a study that motivates research on shape-shifting wall displays, and a shape-shifting display system that responds to explicit and implicit controls to match particular activities.},

The system measures aspects of behaviour that are relevant to the social dynamics of the meeting, speaking time and gaze behaviour, and provides visual feedback about these aspects to the meeting participants through a peripheral display. We describe the system properties and the perceptual components. Also, we present a study aimed at evaluating the effect of such a system on meeting behaviour. Groups of participants, amounting to 82 participants in all, discussed topics of general interest. Analysis of the data of 58 participants showed that feedback influenced the behaviour of the participants in such a way that it made over-participators speak less and underparticipators speak more. Analysis of the micro-patterns of six participants indicated that feedback on gaze behaviour had little effect on the interaction dynamics. We conclude that perceptual technologies can be used to build services that may help people to improve their meeting skills and we consider some ways in which such systems may be deployed in meetings.},

The paper motivates, designs and presents a small evaluation of a technology that is intended to support intimacy at distance. It first presents an ethnographic study examining family communication and the role of artifacts in supporting emotional closeness, e.g. heirlooms, activities and places in the house. The paper then describes a couple of prototypes that were designed to support different types of closeness and how we evaluated one of these prototypes in a study of 3 families (6 households), for two weeks each. The interview data that the study presents show that people were generally positive about the technology, although this depended on the nature of the users' pre-existing communication patterns. One critical point here is about the importance of pairing blue sky design with down-to-earth deployment and demonstrate commendable ethnographic-like work to inform design practice. Finally do we discuss some issues around users experiences of “telematic emotional communication” and how this has enriched our understanding of remote presence.},

In both cases, the relations between the anthropologist and the people involved, prompted reflexive moments that brought anthropological relocations of the designers' perspective. In conclusion, we stress how such relocations could benefit participatory designs through the concept of design by subtraction and the adoption of a feminist perspective.},

While numerous studies investigate real-time participatory engagement of fans on Twitter, athletes’ use of Twitter during competition remains underexplored. Using a case study approach, this study brings together computermediated discourse analysis and prior work on involvement in discourse to examine tweets posted during competitive events by two endurance athletes (an experienced amateur marathon runner and an elite rock climber). Specifically, it explores how athletes mobilize various linguistic strategies to create relations of connectedness, or ambient affiliation (Zappavigna, 2011), with their respective audiences who are distanced spatially and often temporally. It also demonstrates how the affordances and limitations of technology, and the constraints of the athletic events themselves, shape ambient involvement. In this way, this work adds to our understanding of how ambient affiliation is constructed in a particular context – a competitive athletic event of an endurance athlete practicing a solitary sport – while also shedding light on how involvement is created and maintained with a largely unknown online audience.},

This paper concentrates on the use of common, day-to-day items and modifying them to communicate everyday actions while maintaining a sustained and natural usage pattern for strongly paired romantic couples. For this purpose, we propose the "SyncDecor" system, which pairs traditional appliances and allow them to remotely synchronize and provide awareness or cognizance about their partners - thereby creating a virtual "living together" feeling. We present evidence, from a 3month long field study, where traditional appliances provided a significantly more natural, varied and sustained usage patterns which ultimately enhanced communications between the couples.},

Recent research experiments with reversing this imperative. An information display, which is first - aesthetically pleasing and second - is able to display information, is designed and implemented. The display presents an e-mail title in a visual form as a collage of images - each image corresponding to one or more words. It next filters the collage through aesthetic properties specified by an artist, such as colors, texture, and shape. This filter renders the original collage as a pleasing art. We propose an extension of this work by: adding a voice activation module; displaying information of user’s request (versus displaying e-mail titles only); and presenting the display in a form of a decorative digital painting hanging on the wall. The advantages of this approach are: being ambient - in a sense of: entering person’s attention when needed, and largely disappearing into the environment when not needed; and being interactive - as in providing information per user’s interest through speech recognition. This produces new interactive, ambient system for aesthetic information display on user’s demand.},

However, how to address awareness at user perception level represents a challenge for which little progress has been made so far in contrast with considerable advances in designing interaction techniques for such displays. Even though many interactive ambient displays exist with properly designed interfaces, people may not always be aware of their interactivity. This work addresses the problem of interactivity awareness by focusing on two important questions: How can people tell whether a public display is interactive or not? and, assuming interactivity, How can people tell what the interface is? A study was conducted in order to investigate factors potentially related to perceived interactivity. Results show that people’s evaluations are correct in most cases but they also tend to form incorrect perceptions in many other situations. We found that location, installation, reachability, and displayed content are factors that can influence people’s perceptions. Our findings are complemented with a discussion of techniques that can be used in the practice of designing for interactivity awareness.},

Haptic communication via floor surfaces could enhance or enable many computer-supported activities that involve movement on foot. In this paper, we discuss potential applications of such interfaces in everyday environments and present a haptically augmented floor component through which several interaction methods are being evaluated. We describe two approaches to the design of structured vibrotactile signals for this device. The first is centered on a musical phrase metaphor, as employed in prior work on tactile display. The second is based upon the synthesis of rhythmic patterns of virtual physical impact transients. We report on an experiment in which participants were able to identify communication units that were constructed from these signals and displayed via a floor interface at well above chance levels. The results support the feasibility of tactile information display via such interfaces and provide further indications as to how to effectively design vibrotactile signals for them.},

To better understand how people experience these systems over time, and how they blend in the user context, longitudinal field studies are needed. Although tangible awareness systems are considered to be more intimate and aesthetically pleasing than screen based awareness systems, they are not often evaluated in a longitudinal setting. This may be due to several factors that complicate the field evaluation of such systems, including the robustness and reliability of the prototype. This paper describes how the challenges of designing and evaluating a prototype have been addressed in the design of SnowGlobe. The system was evaluated in a longitudinal field setting with 12 users. The prototype enabled extensive data collection on the user experience and usage of such a tangible awareness system.},

While users appreciate the awareness that notifications provide, notifications cause distraction, higher cognitive load, and task interruptions. With the increasing importance of smart environments, the number of sensors that could trigger notifications will increase dramatically. A flower with a moisture sensor, for example, could create a notification whenever the flower needs water. We assume that current notification mechanisms will not scale with the increasing number of notifications. We therefore explore notification mechanisms for smart homes. Notifications are shown on smartphones, on displays in the environment, next to the sending objects, or on the user’s body. In an online survey, we compare the four locations in four scenarios. While different aspects influence the perceived suitability of each notification location, the smartphone generally is rated the best.},

    abstract = {We are exploring "mobile ambient presence" (MAP) as an approach to sustaining unobtrusive social connection. Prior research has shown that ambient technology can support connectedness by conveying social presence. Since mobile devices are typically always-on and often in peripheral vision, they are candidate ambient displays that might convey presence. We tested a MAP app for tablet computers, finding that it sustained connection in two settings where high-fidelity communication media were considered intrusive. In this paper we discuss the advantages and challenges of mobile ambient presence and the contexts in which it could be put to use.},

Body states are body movements and positions that players must discover in order to complete a level and in turn represent a learned game skill. The paper provides an overview of background concepts and related research. We describe the prototype and game structure, provide a technical description of the prototype and discuss technical issues related to sensing, reasoning and display. The paper contributes by providing a method for constructing group parameters from individual parameters with real-time motion capture data; and a model for mapping the trajectory of participant’s actions in order to determine an intensity level used to manage the experience flow of the game and its representation in audio and visual display. We conclude with a discussion of known and outstanding technical issues, and future research.},

Our study involved the playing of our prototype system by thirty-six (36) participants grouped into teams of four (4). Our aim was to determine heuristics that we could use to further design the interaction and user model approaches for group and embodied interaction systems. We analyzed group interaction and performance based on factors of team cohesion and goal focus. We found that with our system, these factors alone could not explain performance. However, when transitions in the degrees of each factor, i.e. high, medium or low are considered, a clearer picture for performance emerges. The significance of the results is that they describe recognizable factors for positive group interaction.},

However, the main effect of display luminance was statistically significant on visual discrimination performance, but ambient illumination was not significant. As for the combination effect of display luminance and ambient illumination, viewers felt the most comfortable and with the best visual performance in the high level of display luminance and the high level of ambient illumination. It is expected to find out the optimal condition to ensure the viewer’s visual comfort. As for the future work, the dynamic image factor may be taken into account.},

We present a novel algorithm based on multi-label graph cut for segmenting video into temporally coherent region maps. These maps are used to both stylize video into cartoons and paintings, and measure visual similarity between frames for smooth sequence transitions. The system automatically structures the media collection into a hierarchical representation based on visual content and semantics. Graph optimization is applied to adaptively sequence content for display in a coarse-to-fine manner, driven by user attention level (detected in real-time by a webcam). Our system is deployed on embedded hardware in the form of a compact digital photo frame. We demonstrate coherent segmentation and stylization over a variety of home videos and photos. We evaluate our media sequencing algorithm via a small-scale user study, indicating that our adaptive display conveys a more compelling media consumption experience than simple linear ‘‘slide-shows’’.},

The installation has been developed as a prototypical example in architectural education at the ETH Zurich, Science City. The aim of the project is to generate a novel experience, which shows the potential of merging physical architecture and digital information. The article newly develops architecture as an interface that reveals information about the building itself, its occupants, and/or its environment. It describes the research that employs design experimentation and information visualization with the use of computersupported, interactive, visual representations of abstract data to amplify cognition. This questions the way in which one perceives the own body spatiality and motility in physical and augmented environments and how the particular experience created by this juxtaposition evokes one’s awareness of the motility in the public. The paper suggests that introducing this kind of display in a social scenario can enrich the casual interaction of people nearby and this might enhance social awareness and engagement.},

In my implementations, information is displayed solely through tactile modalities such as thermal change (heating and cooling), movement (shifting and vibration), and change of shape (expanding, contracting, and deformation). Using a tactile display allows information to be kept private and reduces the chance of overloading primary visual and auditory activities. The display can remain ambient, transmitting information in the background of a person's perception through simple, physical means.},

People manage demands on their attention by limiting their availability to others, and this may cause failure in attempts to reach others. In today’s always-connected world, we know very little about how people manage their own availability, maintain awareness of others, and adapt their strategies for reaching others in the face of failure. This paper draws on results from a qualitative field study to present an integrative, joint action approach to attention management. Results suggest that mobile devices play a large part in assessing ambient awareness of others and signaling availability, but are rarely used in isolation. Attention is a continuum that spans multiple devices and channels involving actions and choices learned over time.},

    abstract = {The human body is designed for regular movement. Many humans, however, spend the bulk of their day sitting still instead. On average, for instance an adult spends approximately 10 hours each day sitting–in Asia, Europe as well as US. While a brief period of sitting here and there is natural, long periods of sitting day-in and day-out can seriously impact health and are associated with a significantly higher risk of heart disease, diabetes, obesity, cancer, and depression, as well as muscle and joint problems. Even working out vigorously may not compensate for long sitting sessions. The key is to build frequent movement variety into the day and to change the sitting position from time to time. About every 20-30 minutes the body needs a posture break by moving for a couple of minutes or, at least, by changing the sitting position.},

The system will now be subject to a longer experience study that will determine its actual impact on the working environment.

Due to the immediate correspondence between the arrangement of stones and the shape of sand with sonic features it also becomes a persistent visualization of the current sonic ambience. Thus it offers a conceptually different and ‘calm’ way of reviewing and specifying sounds. The paper focuses on the conceptual ideas and showcases our current system. We demonstrate some initial ambiences and conclude with current ideas on how to embed and evaluate SoZen in the context of a smart apartment environment.},

However, these technologies heavily rely on giving individual feedback on water intake and self-monitoring as a behavior change strategy. We expanded this existing design space with a new concept: Wwall, a smart water dispenser system which differs from previous examples as it 1) gives collective feedback along with individual feedback via an ambient display, and 2) uses cooperation to motivate regular water intake.

But when the user’s approach is recognized, the display provides three-dimensional spatial navigation through the image space.

Through the design of the DeLight system, we aim to establish a biofeedback-driven lighting environment that informs users about their stress level for intervention and assists them in biofeedback relaxation training. In this study, DeLight is interfaced with a heart rate variability biofeedback system with two modes for different purposes: stress intervention and relaxation assistance. We evaluated the prototype of DeLight in two user studies. The results of the first study show that DeLight has the potential for stress intervention; the HRV biofeedback through the changes of ambient light could improve a user’s awareness of stress and trigger behavioral conditioning, such as deep breathing. The results of the second study confirm that DeLight has potential as a new biofeedback interface for relaxation assistance; biofeedback through an immersive lighting environment can support physiological regulation as effectively as graphic biofeedback; it offers enhanced relaxation effects regarding both subjective experience and physiological arousal. These findings suggest that the biofeedback-driven ambient light can perform as persuasive technology in the domain of health self-management. The combination of decorative and informative aspects enables the lighting interface to offer the users a comfortable and relaxing condition for biofeedback-assisted relaxation training.},

The surface design basically consists of two layers: the pattern layer (front layer) and the actuating layer (back layer). The first is a complex paper-based structure with repetitive incisions created by laser cutting. The actuating layer serves as a medium transforming the force from servomotors, vibration motors or fans into an action on the pattern layer. The cutout patterns are stimulated to vibrate, swing, bulge, or rotate which is used to display physiological information in dynamic physical form. This work has been exhibited on Milan Design Week 2015; we collected and analyzed the feedback from the visitors during the exhibition and discuss the possibilities of the proposed surfaces as a shape-changing interface of biofeedback or an ambient display of information.},

    abstract = {Background: Problems with prospective memory, which refers to the ability to remember future intentions, cause deficits in basic and instrumental activities of daily living, such as taking medications. Older adults show minimal deficits when they rely on mostly preserved and relatively automatic associative retrieval processes. On the basis of this, we propose to provide external cues to support the automatic retrieval of an intended action, that is, to take medicines. To reach this end, we developed the Medication Ambient Display (MAD), a system that unobtrusively presents relevant information (unless it requires the users’ attention) and uses different abstract modalities to provide external cues that enable older adults to easily take their medications on time and be aware of their medication adherence. Objective: This study aimed to assess the adoption and effect of external cues provided through ambient displays on medication adherence in older adults. Methods: A total of 16 older adults, who took at least three medications and had mild cognitive impairment, participated in the study. We conducted a 12-week feasibility study in which we used a mixed methods approach to collect qualitative and quantitative evidence. The study included baseline, intervention, and postintervention phases. Half of the participants were randomly allocated to the treatment group (n=8), and the other half was assigned to the control group (n=8). During the study phases, research assistants measured medication adherence weekly through the pill counting technique. Results: The treatment group improved their adherence behavior from 80.9\% at baseline to 95.97\% using the MAD in the intervention phase. This decreased to 76.71\% in the postintervention phase when the MAD was no longer being used. Using a one-way repeated measures analysis of variance and a post hoc analysis using the Tukey honestly significant difference test, we identified a significant statistical difference between the preintervention and intervention phases (P=.02) and between the intervention and postintervention phases (P=.002). In addition, the medication adherence rate of the treatment group (95.97\%) was greater than that of the control group (88.18\%) during the intervention phase. Our qualitative results showed that the most useful cues were the auditory reminders, followed by the stylized representations of medication adherence. We also found that the MAD’s external cues not only improved older adults’ medication adherence but also mediated family caregivers’ involvement. Conclusions: The findings of this study demonstrate that using ambient modalities for implementing external cues is useful for drawing the attention of older adults to remind them to take medications and to provide immediate awareness on adherence behavior.},

    abstract = {In this paper we describe a novel photo sharing system called 4streams. This is an ambient photo display that allows a small group of users to keep in touch through a kind of visual twitter feed of concurrent photographs from their mobile phones. The photographs of up to four users are displayed in a dynamic collage in the four quadrants of a dedicated ambient display, with photographs to each quadrant arriving in real time as photographs are taken/uploaded. Historical photos can also be browsed or played back in lockstep with each other, as a reminder of what each member of the group was doing over the same period of time. The system was trailed over seven weeks by an extended family distributed over three countries. The findings suggest that the system increases the social connection and presence between children, parents and grandparents of an intergenerational family living apart. This was not only through ’visual status’ images of family members living in different places, but also through updates of collocated members travelling away from home, and deliberately crafted images designed to elicit responses or trigger discussions in other media. The implications of these findings for theories of photo sharing are discussed.},

    abstract = {This paper describes DeskJockey, a system to provide users with additional display space by projecting information on passive physical surfaces in the environment. The current DeskJockey prototype utilizes a projected desk and allows information to be moved easily between active and passive displays using a world-in-miniature interaction metaphor. A four-week, in-situ field study was conducted to compare usage of DeskJockey with typical multiple monitor use. The results revealed potential for utilizing passive physical surfaces in this manner and demonstrated that this type of display space has distinctive affordances and benefits which enhance traditional display space.},
